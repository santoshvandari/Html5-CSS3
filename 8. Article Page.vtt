00:00.330 --> 00:05.820
All right so in the last video we created our boat page and we added the page container which is going

00:05.820 --> 00:08.940
to be the grid that we use for all in our pages.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.310
Now the article does each channel is going to be pretty similar.

00:13.320 --> 00:18.900
We're gonna add like a couple extra things in the main article but the layout will be the same basically.

00:19.140 --> 00:26.400
So going to copy the about Dot each team all content and go to Article dot each to Ellen Page set in.

00:26.400 --> 00:26.750
All right.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.670
And then we'll go up to the top here.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.340
Let's change the title.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.170
We'll just say

00:33.930 --> 00:41.150
for the title we'll just say the latest news I guess it doesn't really matter.

00:41.280 --> 00:46.230
And then we want to remove the current from the about so we're not going to have a class of current

00:46.230 --> 00:49.250
because the article page is not in the menu.

00:49.590 --> 00:56.100
And then for the section let's give it an idea of article like that and we're going to keep the page

00:56.100 --> 00:56.840
contain.

00:56.850 --> 01:06.750
We're going to keep the the article tag here and let's see for the h 1 0 1 thing we didn't do is is

01:06.750 --> 01:08.200
add the L heading.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.050
So let's do that real quick.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.100
So that's obviously a utility class.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.320
So let's put it

01:17.960 --> 01:19.510
put it right under the padding here.

01:19.520 --> 01:26.570
So let's say a class l heading and I believe I did.

01:26.570 --> 01:30.490
Font Size 3 room.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.120
Let's see what that looks like.

01:32.150 --> 01:32.690
All right yeah.

01:32.750 --> 01:33.030
Good.

01:33.770 --> 01:39.440
So for the article we have our heading which I'm going to change.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.490
I'm just going to do large five for the title.

01:43.490 --> 01:46.970
And underneath the H one we're gonna have some metadata.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.470
Okay so an article or a blog post usually will have things like the author date stuff like that.

01:54.470 --> 02:00.370
So we're gonna create a class a div with the class of meta and inside meta.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.660
I'm going to put a small tag.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.550
OK I don't I don't know if we went over small tags.

02:05.570 --> 02:13.580
Basically it's an it's an inline element that will make the text smaller by default I forget what the

02:13.580 --> 02:16.350
percentages but it makes it a little smaller.

02:16.400 --> 02:22.370
And then in here I'm going to I'm going to put an icon of a user just make sure we use font awesome

02:22.370 --> 02:22.850
up here.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.330
Yes we did.

02:24.330 --> 02:31.620
So let's say I with the class of F.A. s dots F A Dash user.

02:31.670 --> 02:34.970
And the reason I want this icon is because I'm putting the author's name.

02:35.030 --> 02:42.770
So it's just a little icon next to the author name we're gonna say written let's say written by John

02:42.770 --> 02:45.900
Doe and then we'll just put the date.

02:45.930 --> 02:54.420
I'll just say like January January 12th 2019.

02:55.030 --> 03:01.070
Okay so that's in the small tag and then we want to have a div with the class of category because we

03:01.070 --> 03:03.140
want to put the category here as well.

03:03.230 --> 03:10.580
And this is we're going to say an entertainment article so we have a class of category dash Ian T and

03:10.580 --> 03:21.650
let's say entertainment and then let's see under that we can just keep the same text.

03:21.650 --> 03:24.380
But one thing that we do need is an image.

03:24.380 --> 03:27.870
So I'm going to put the image above the H1 actually.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.350
So we'll do image.

03:29.570 --> 03:38.780
Let's point to image slash articles and we'll use and one since this is an entertainment article and

03:38.780 --> 03:41.390
that should be good.

03:41.390 --> 03:42.140
Let's see.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.060
Let's save it and let's see what it looks like.

03:44.060 --> 03:49.250
So if I go to the home page I have all of these pointing to Article dot h t email and that's what it's

03:49.250 --> 03:52.460
going to look like and we're going to style this matter a little bit.

03:52.460 --> 03:57.740
But I also want to add an extra box on the side here are right here up above.

03:57.890 --> 04:00.740
Which will be a list of categories.

04:00.830 --> 04:07.730
So let's scroll down here to where we have our aside which is the join our club and I'm going to change

04:07.730 --> 04:14.290
the color for this page will say secondary that's what's good about having these utility classes that

04:14.300 --> 04:19.970
you can easily change things around the site and then you have variables in the CSX file which makes

04:19.970 --> 04:22.220
it easy to change the values.

04:22.220 --> 04:30.560
Now I want to go right above this and let's create another aside and this aside is also going to it's

04:30.560 --> 04:40.040
going to have an I.D. of categories but let's give it a class of card and we'll put an H two in here

04:40.040 --> 04:41.930
and we'll say categories

04:46.510 --> 04:53.670
and under the H two we'll have a L and we're gonna use our lists class and we'll do an ally and let's

04:53.670 --> 04:58.180
just put a link that goes nowhere and we're gonna have this.

04:58.380 --> 05:05.280
We're gonna put little Chevron icons next to each one so let's use font awesome here we'll do I dot

05:05.310 --> 05:17.150
F.A. s and the icon is F.A. dash Chevron dash right like that and then let's put a space after it and

05:17.150 --> 05:25.160
then we'll put sports OK and then I'm gonna grab this and just copy it down let's do one two three four

05:25.160 --> 05:29.060
more and we'll change this one let's see we have sports

05:32.510 --> 05:38.390
entertainment let's do technology

05:41.020 --> 05:43.720
fashion and shopping.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.630
It doesn't matter.

05:45.470 --> 05:45.930
OK.

05:45.940 --> 05:46.980
So save that.

05:46.990 --> 05:53.120
And there we go it automatically gets put in the sidebar so the grid is pretty powerful.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.870
You know we just add display grid.

05:54.910 --> 06:01.840
Add a couple grid template columns maybe some spans and we have our layout for all of our inner pages

06:02.080 --> 06:05.060
without having to do floats or anything like that.

06:05.080 --> 06:10.260
Now I just want to style this this meta area because it doesn't look very good it's very squished together

06:10.270 --> 06:16.540
I just want and I also want to give it like some some a look of texture so we'll add a background color

06:16.540 --> 06:17.770
to it as well.

06:17.860 --> 06:26.760
So let's go into our style sheet here and let's go down.

06:26.770 --> 06:30.840
We're targeting something that's on a specific page now.

06:30.840 --> 06:40.720
So going to go under home articles right above the footer and let's say the idea of article

06:43.870 --> 06:45.680
and then we want the class of meta

06:48.640 --> 06:51.070
so I'm actually going to use flex for this.

06:51.070 --> 06:55.570
This is this is definitely something that you would use flex for and you can see the difference between

06:55.570 --> 06:58.990
using grid and flex like the grid is good for this type of thing.

06:58.990 --> 07:05.290
This this the layout of all the boxes and stuff and then flex is good for inner elements aligning stuff

07:05.290 --> 07:12.670
like this or menus and you know just small simple stuff that's that's one dimensional.

07:12.670 --> 07:19.840
So let's say display flex and you could use the grid for this but I think it's it's stupid to use the

07:19.840 --> 07:30.940
grid for this and then we're going to let's let's justify our content and we want to we want to do space

07:30.940 --> 07:38.560
between K I want I want the category to be over to the right because if we look at the markup in the

07:38.560 --> 07:41.480
meta we have this is now a flex box right.

07:41.500 --> 07:45.070
And then the small tag is going to be one flex item.

07:45.070 --> 07:48.100
This is another and we want space in between the two.

07:48.100 --> 07:58.780
So it pushes the category over and then let's do a actually let's do a line items center as well and

07:58.780 --> 08:01.620
then we'll do a background.

08:02.560 --> 08:07.210
Gonna do a background of Triple E and just add some padding.

08:07.210 --> 08:13.760
So zero point five room and let's save that take a look good.

08:13.780 --> 08:19.830
Now this even though we align center this this category I want to push it down just a little bit.

08:19.850 --> 08:38.110
So let's do article dot met a category and same margin top let's do zero point for random and that just

08:38.110 --> 08:41.050
pushes it down a little bit into the middle.

08:41.050 --> 08:41.350
OK.

08:41.380 --> 08:46.550
So I think that's it guys are our site is complete except for the responsiveness of it.

08:46.570 --> 08:53.290
If I if we bring this down to Mobile size you'll see that things two things don't look very well.

08:53.290 --> 08:58.990
So we're gonna have to just add some media queries and make this look good.

08:58.990 --> 09:01.120
All right so I'll start doing that in the next video.
