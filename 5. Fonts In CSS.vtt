WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:05.760
All right guys in this video we're going to look at fonts specifically the font family property and

00:05.760 --> 00:07.680
font size property.

00:07.680 --> 00:13.170
So you might want to use different styles of fonts in different Web sites and different user interfaces.

00:13.170 --> 00:14.820
So we're going to take a look at how to do that.

00:14.820 --> 00:21.780
We're going to talk about Web say fonts and also how to use fonts from from other sources like Google

00:21.780 --> 00:22.820
fonts.

00:22.860 --> 00:31.170
So let's create a new file here called 0 3 underscore fonts start HD HTML and we're going to put our

00:31.170 --> 00:40.950
boiler plate in here and let's go down and just change the title to fonts and let's put our style tags

00:40.950 --> 00:48.120
in here for our CSX and then I'm going to copy from the last file the selectors just the two divs that

00:48.120 --> 00:54.800
are in the HDMI all here just so we can use them as a as text display.

00:54.870 --> 01:00.690
So I'm going to save this and then open with five server and let's make it a little bigger a whole control

01:00.690 --> 01:04.280
and hit the plus symbol and just make these a little bigger.

01:04.290 --> 01:04.800
All right.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.760
So in our style right here let's add a selector for the body.

01:10.770 --> 01:15.270
That's usually where you're going to add your font family because then it affects your whole page right.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.600
So the fonts for your whole page.

01:17.640 --> 01:22.750
So we want to use font dash family which takes in a font stack.

01:22.770 --> 01:29.290
So basically a list of different fonts in Invesco we get this cool dropdown speaking of font stacks

01:29.290 --> 01:30.610
that we can choose from.

01:30.690 --> 01:34.400
But before we get into that I want to take a look at web save fonts.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.150
Now you have the ability to use pretty much any font that you want.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.300
You can get your hands on.

01:39.300 --> 01:45.540
But if they're not these web save fonts then you're going to want to include them include the actual

01:45.540 --> 01:51.450
font files within your Web site just like you would include a CSX file and you can also link to them

01:51.450 --> 01:54.470
remotely which I'm going to show you how to do with Google fonts.

01:54.660 --> 01:59.300
But these right here you don't need to do anything extra for because they're going to they're going

01:59.300 --> 02:05.690
to be available in all all browsers that users are using to view your Web site with.

02:05.790 --> 02:10.550
And notice that there is some of these there's multiple fonts.

02:10.620 --> 02:12.810
These are actually called font stacks.

02:12.810 --> 02:16.860
For instance this first one aerial Helvetica sans serif.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.380
What's going to happen is it's going to look for the aerial font to use it.

02:20.460 --> 02:23.610
If it can't find that it will move to use Helvetica.

02:23.730 --> 02:27.510
If it can't find that a little use to use any sans serif font.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.540
So basically you have sans serif and serif and these.

02:30.540 --> 02:33.330
This is an example of what these look like.

02:33.330 --> 02:40.110
So basically a Sarah font has these these edges these points on the edge and a sans serif font is like

02:40.110 --> 02:45.840
a flat look for the most part you're probably going to want to use a sans serif font because they just

02:45.900 --> 02:47.160
they just look neater.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.870
They also look much more modern.

02:48.870 --> 02:55.110
And part of the reason for that is because times new roman which is a very Sarah font is the default.

02:55.170 --> 02:55.450
OK.

02:55.470 --> 03:01.430
So when we don't add a font family that's what's used some of my favorite web save fonts or aerial.

03:01.530 --> 03:04.480
I also like for Dan I like to Homa.

03:04.500 --> 03:09.560
So let's jump back into V.S. code and in Chrome and by default.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.330
Like I said it's using sans serif.

03:11.340 --> 03:16.000
You can see the kind of like the point see the a right here.

03:16.020 --> 03:23.400
So I want to change this to Ariel now obvious code if I just type in a Ariel health health Ariel Helvetica

03:23.430 --> 03:25.880
sans serif is actually an option.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.870
OK so this is a font stack.

03:27.870 --> 03:31.360
Like I said it's going to look for Ariel then Helvetica sans serif.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.850
If I save this.

03:32.850 --> 03:36.990
Notice how it changes into a flatter looking font.

03:36.990 --> 03:37.530
OK.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.170
Let's try something else.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.730
Let's try for Danna.

03:41.730 --> 03:46.440
So just if I just put a V in there it's going to ver Dan is going to pop up.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.470
So we have Vedanta Geneva to home a sans serif.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.640
Save it.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.240
It's a little different but it's still a sans serif font.

03:54.240 --> 04:02.040
OK so if you want to use something different something that isn't in that list I showed you then what

04:02.040 --> 04:04.540
I would recommend is using Google fonts.

04:04.560 --> 04:11.180
So I'm going to open up a new browser here and just make it bigger.

04:11.530 --> 04:20.220
And let's head over to fonts dot google dot com so here you can go over to search.

04:20.220 --> 04:23.490
You can search for certain fonts you can browse them if you want.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.360
You can see samples of them.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.660
I like rubato.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.090
That's what I use quite a bit.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.670
And you see it pops up over here.

04:31.680 --> 04:38.240
There's rubato rubato condensed or bottom mono slab so let's say we want to use this rubato font.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.160
We can click this plus sign right here and we get this little pop up.

04:42.180 --> 04:47.220
And if I click on that it shows us how we can bring this in to our HD PML.

04:47.220 --> 04:52.900
We can do it using a link tag just like we do with just regular CSX files.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.760
We can also import it into our CSX like this.

04:56.760 --> 05:02.460
Usually I do import it but since we're putting our CSX in the team I'll file I'm just going to use the

05:02.460 --> 05:02.910
link.

05:03.790 --> 05:04.110
OK.

05:04.140 --> 05:09.510
So if we grab that and then it shows us how we can actually implement it we can just add the font family

05:09.570 --> 05:12.360
and then rubato sans serif.

05:12.360 --> 05:23.700
So let's go back into v as code and let's open up our our other browser here and let's go right below

05:23.700 --> 05:28.120
the next year we'll go right above the title and paste in that link.

05:28.140 --> 05:28.390
OK.

05:28.410 --> 05:35.230
So it links to fonts a Google API dot com slash CSX and then as a parameter it has family equals or

05:35.230 --> 05:36.120
bottle.

05:36.120 --> 05:45.840
So now we should be able to go ahead and put in Votto just like it said and then sans serif and if I

05:45.840 --> 05:49.910
save it there we go and that looks pretty pretty nice and clean.

05:49.910 --> 05:57.530
I really like the rubato font so that's how we can use basically non web save fonts.

05:58.170 --> 05:58.550
OK.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.820
So next thing I want to look at is font size.

06:01.860 --> 06:05.800
OK so let's say font size.

06:05.820 --> 06:10.790
Now the standard is 16 pixels and that's actually on the HD PML tag.

06:10.860 --> 06:17.850
The HDL tag by default has a font size of 16 pixels that's what you're seeing that we do have this zoomed

06:17.850 --> 06:18.620
in a little bit.

06:18.630 --> 06:22.880
That's why it's bigger actually let's put it back to just.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.260
Let's put it back to just 100 percent.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.860
So I'm going to do control and then the minus.

06:28.110 --> 06:30.060
And that's 110 that's 100.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.650
So that's the default.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.860
So let's change it to 18 pixels.

06:34.120 --> 06:34.290
OK.

06:34.430 --> 06:37.540
And for the most part I usually leave it at 16.

06:37.650 --> 06:42.520
But just to show you I'll change it to 18 save and I can see it's bigger.

06:42.810 --> 06:48.570
Also we can adjust the line height which is basically the height of each line.

06:48.750 --> 06:53.600
So let's say line X line dash height.

06:53.880 --> 06:58.310
And this is going to this is usually in m units which is a relative unit.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.990
Now I'm going to go over Ramón M units later on.

07:01.230 --> 07:08.490
So don't worry if you don't really understand this but a common common value I like to use for the line

07:08.490 --> 07:13.930
height for the body is one point six AM and we'll save.

07:13.930 --> 07:18.090
And notice how now there there's more space in between each line.

07:18.090 --> 07:18.410
OK.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.050
So I think it makes it look a little cleaner.

07:21.510 --> 07:26.300
Now I want to talk a little bit about units so pixels and so on.

07:26.340 --> 07:32.400
Now looking at this list of CSX units this one which is absolute units and then we also have relative

07:32.400 --> 07:37.380
units it may be a little overwhelming but don't worry about it because we don't use most of these.

07:37.380 --> 07:44.850
In fact the only thing we're going to use on this page is pixels pixels as that is the the common absolute

07:45.210 --> 07:50.800
unit that you're going to use you can use centimeters you can use millimeters inches.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.980
You can set your font to one inch if you want but that's not something that you're probably going to

07:55.980 --> 08:03.630
do what you're going to use as pixels and the exact size of size of one pixel is one ninety six of one

08:03.630 --> 08:04.460
inch.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.040
OK.

08:05.040 --> 08:11.470
There's also points points may be familiar from something like Microsoft Word and one point is one seventy

08:11.470 --> 08:16.920
two of one inch you may run into points but for the most part you're going to see pixels.

08:16.950 --> 08:20.690
You also have peak is which it's actually equal to twelve point scale.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.620
You're not going to really see that.

08:22.710 --> 08:27.030
Now there's also something called relative units which I'm going to get into later I'm not going to

08:27.030 --> 08:31.400
really focus on this right now but for instance you have percentage.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.850
You can set it to percentage of a parent element.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.340
And by the way this doesn't have to be just font size.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.410
This could be for margin padding line height.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.370
What else with height.

08:43.380 --> 08:44.600
All that stuff.

08:44.810 --> 08:45.210
OK.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.010
You also have m in RAM units.

08:47.010 --> 08:54.750
M is basically it's a multiplier so whatever the size of your parent element let's say the parent div

08:54.750 --> 09:03.480
to a paragraph is is 16 pixels and you set it set it to 1 m that's going to be equal to 16 pixels if

09:03.480 --> 09:11.010
you set it to one point two m that will be equal to 16 pixels time's one point two REM units act the

09:11.010 --> 09:17.280
same way except instead of the parent element they use the root H team l element which by default is

09:17.280 --> 09:18.940
sixteen pixels.

09:18.990 --> 09:24.420
So if you set it to one REM by default it'll be set to 16 pixels.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.220
And if this is confusing the crap out of you.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.050
Don't worry we're gonna get into this stuff later.

09:29.160 --> 09:33.660
I'm not even going to bother going over viewport with an viewport height right now.

09:33.660 --> 09:39.480
All right let's head back into v as code and I'm actually going to put the font family back to aerial

09:40.430 --> 09:47.820
or aerial Helvetica sans serif and I just want to show you a couple more font properties.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.940
So I want to look at font weight and font style which are very simple.

09:50.940 --> 09:56.970
They're basically used to make some text bold or make Text Italic.

09:57.180 --> 10:01.830
So I'm going to add a span in here so let's say span.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.130
I'm going to take the ending tag here.

10:04.140 --> 10:05.550
Control C copy it.

10:05.550 --> 10:12.900
Delete it and then put that there and also put a span down here.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.990
Stu span and we'll take the ending tag.

10:17.990 --> 10:20.890
Put that down here.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.230
All right.

10:21.230 --> 10:22.100
So let's save that.

10:22.130 --> 10:27.230
Let's go up here and I want to show you how to target these spans.

10:27.320 --> 10:31.990
So for this one here we can say we want to go into the welcome div..

10:32.020 --> 10:37.220
OK so the div has the idea of welcome and then we want to go into the paragraph and then we want to

10:37.220 --> 10:38.450
go into that span.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.100
So that's how we can target this first span right here.

10:42.110 --> 10:47.690
Now technically we don't even need the paragraph because it's still going to look into this div with

10:47.690 --> 10:48.820
the idea of welcome.

10:48.830 --> 10:50.620
And then onto this span.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.080
But I think it's more organized to keep the paragraph in there.

10:54.620 --> 10:54.980
OK.

10:54.980 --> 11:04.490
Just as an extra step and let's say we want to make the font weight bold and notice that this.

11:04.670 --> 11:11.030
This V.S. code gives us the selections which we could use numbers to make them more or less bold but

11:11.030 --> 11:13.790
we're just going to choose bold and save.

11:13.820 --> 11:18.950
And notice how now the span the text it's within the span is bold.

11:18.950 --> 11:24.610
OK so just like the strong tag we can set it to bold through CSX.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.810
So let's target this.

11:25.820 --> 11:37.970
This span down here by saying we want the about div paragraph span and we're going to set the font style

11:38.480 --> 11:41.810
to italic and save.

11:41.810 --> 11:47.060
And now you can see it is very faint but this text is now italic.

11:47.060 --> 11:53.160
So these are the font based properties in the next video I want to start to get into colors.

11:53.300 --> 11:57.320
And you saw that I used for instance the color name like red and green.

11:57.320 --> 12:04.810
I also use this weird this no sign and then some some letters that's actually called hexadecimal.

12:04.820 --> 12:08.960
We also have something called our G.B. so I want to look at colors and the different types that we can

12:08.960 --> 12:10.520
use in CSX.
