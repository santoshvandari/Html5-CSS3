WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:00.840
All right guys.

00:00.840 --> 00:04.610
Now we're going to start to talk about animation in CSX.

00:04.620 --> 00:10.140
And there's a few ways to do animations you have key frames which you're going to be looking at.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.280
Now we also have transitions.

00:12.450 --> 00:19.320
Basically when you animate something and CSX what it means is you're taking a property that can be animated

00:19.320 --> 00:28.740
such as a with a position a color opacity something like that where you have basically you have midpoint.

00:28.800 --> 00:35.820
So let's take a width for example you have zero pixels and let's say you go to six hundred pixels.

00:35.820 --> 00:39.110
Well there's there's all the pixels in between.

00:39.110 --> 00:44.250
So you can go from zero to six hundred pixels you can animate that so you can make something grow or

00:44.250 --> 00:45.130
shrink.

00:45.150 --> 00:48.390
You also have positions so you can move things around.

00:48.930 --> 00:53.010
You have opacity so you can fade things in Fade things out.

00:53.010 --> 00:54.270
Stuff like that.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.690
So let's get started with key frames.

00:56.730 --> 01:06.650
So I'm going to create a new file here I'm going to call it 0 7 underscore key frames dot HD hymnal.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.980
Let's put in our stuff here.

01:10.980 --> 01:17.540
Sure you guys are so coherent and we say that and do this but just want to set everything up from scratch.

01:17.580 --> 01:17.850
All right.

01:17.870 --> 01:24.150
So key frames now as far as the H team l we're gonna have a single div with the class of box.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.230
That's it.

01:25.230 --> 01:25.530
OK.

01:25.540 --> 01:30.510
We're going to create this this div basically it's gonna be a square and we're going to animated.

01:30.510 --> 01:32.220
So in the style.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.360
Let's let's start off by doing body.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.490
I'm going to give it a dark background.

01:41.370 --> 01:42.750
All right let's open this up.

01:44.190 --> 01:53.130
So if dark background and then for the box let's make this a white box by default.

01:53.250 --> 01:59.070
So back ground I will make this white.

01:59.070 --> 01:59.750
Actually you know what.

01:59.790 --> 02:04.990
Let's use let's use words because we're gonna be animating the colors.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.810
So background y obviously nothing is going to show up because it's empty there's no content in it.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.740
So that means we have to add a width and height.

02:12.770 --> 02:23.070
So we'll say with 200 picks and height 200 picks and save and now we have a white box it's 200 pixels

02:23.730 --> 02:26.170
wide into and pixels high.

02:26.190 --> 02:32.130
Now what I want to do is let's and let's end and meet the width.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.790
First of all so when it comes to animation we have a bunch of different properties and then we also

02:38.790 --> 02:44.680
can combine them much like we can with many other properties like border background stuff like that

02:44.700 --> 02:46.560
but let's look at each one one by one.

02:46.560 --> 02:56.790
So first I'm going to do animation dash name and I'm going to call this intimate let's do animate one

02:58.530 --> 03:02.550
and let's do an inmate

03:05.100 --> 03:08.640
duration case this is the time that it should take to animate.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.800
I'm going to say two seconds.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.190
All right.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.770
Now why is this giving me an error here.

03:15.770 --> 03:21.530
It's probably because we didn't create animate one.

03:22.040 --> 03:22.490
I'm sorry.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.820
Animation duration.

03:24.820 --> 03:25.680
OK.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.580
Now this animate one right here.

03:28.580 --> 03:28.970
This.

03:28.970 --> 03:32.330
We have to create a key frame called inmate 1.

03:32.390 --> 03:39.360
So we're going to go down below and we're gonna say at key frames and then enemy 1.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.850
And you can call it whatever you want.

03:40.850 --> 03:48.070
I just chose inmate 1 so we can basically specify points in the animation.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.010
Now I'm going to do this.

03:49.010 --> 03:53.540
The simplest way first from first just to show you.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.890
And that's from and to.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.920
So we'll say from.

03:58.010 --> 04:02.890
So from we could say like so let's extend the width.

04:02.900 --> 04:18.890
So if we could say from with 200 picks and then to set with two let's say 600 picks and let's save and

04:18.890 --> 04:19.400
then we go.

04:19.430 --> 04:24.310
So you can see that we get that little animation now since it's 200 pix to begin with.

04:24.320 --> 04:32.240
We don't even need the from like we could simply say to with 600 picks and if I save it still it still

04:32.240 --> 04:33.350
works.

04:33.350 --> 04:36.410
Now there's some other things that we can add here.

04:36.410 --> 04:41.180
And by the way if you want to change the duration to five seconds now it's going to take five seconds

04:41.180 --> 04:45.740
for that to happen for it to extend to 600 pixels.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.090
We're going to change it back to 2.

04:48.170 --> 04:51.060
Notice how it only goes once.

04:51.320 --> 05:00.880
What we could do is add in animation dash iteration count and to right now it's set to 1.

05:00.890 --> 05:04.490
But let's set it to 2 and let's save and see what happens.

05:04.550 --> 05:08.640
So we get 1 2 and then stops.

05:08.790 --> 05:09.090
OK.

05:09.090 --> 05:11.880
Now if you wanted to keep going you can use infinite.

05:12.360 --> 05:18.570
So I'll save and it'll just keep going.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.440
Now I'm going to set this back to 1

05:23.910 --> 05:24.940
which is the default.

05:24.960 --> 05:32.490
And I'm going to add another property here called animation dash filled dash mode.

05:32.610 --> 05:39.540
So right now notice that once it's done animating once it's done stretching out it goes back to the

05:39.540 --> 05:42.650
to its default of two hundred pixels right.

05:42.690 --> 05:46.770
So what if we want to keep it at that stretched out six hundred pixels.

05:46.770 --> 05:53.070
We can change this to forwards OK so if we save this now it's going to anime and it's going to stay

05:53.550 --> 05:55.290
where it's at.

05:55.430 --> 05:56.380
All right.

05:56.810 --> 06:06.230
Let's see we also have just to show you some more properties we have animation delay which shall set

06:06.230 --> 06:07.520
to two seconds.

06:07.550 --> 06:12.630
So now once they save it's going to wait two seconds and then it's going to start OK.

06:12.650 --> 06:15.550
So it's going to delay the start of the animation.

06:15.560 --> 06:25.200
We also have animation dash direction and let's set that to alternate.

06:25.580 --> 06:34.600
So if we save that actually notes it's two alternate dash or does it alternate reverse

06:37.330 --> 06:41.180
so then it's going to go reverse so you can do that as well.

06:41.370 --> 06:44.850
We're going to keep it our alternate.

06:46.090 --> 06:54.960
And then the last one I'm going to show you is the timing function so animation dash timing dash function.

06:55.210 --> 07:03.610
And this is basically like the the motion and you could do like ease ease in which is going to kind

07:03.610 --> 07:07.350
of start off and start off fast.

07:07.360 --> 07:14.190
And then like ease in or ease out which will start off slow and then go faster.

07:14.190 --> 07:20.760
So let's look at ease in there's not too much of a difference at least in my opinion.

07:20.800 --> 07:26.800
Let's make the let's make the duration a little longer we'll say five seconds and let's watch the motion

07:26.800 --> 07:29.180
near it's going to delay.

07:29.180 --> 07:33.250
So it starts off slow and then it starts to go faster.

07:33.250 --> 07:38.640
All right let's let's actually comment out the delay but let's do ease.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.280
Oh and see the difference.

07:40.310 --> 07:47.220
So save and so it starts fast and then it slows down and then you can also do ease in our

07:49.970 --> 07:53.970
ease in O which will start off slow in and slow.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.850
So it eases out.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.830
And then it eases in all right those are the different timing functions that you can use

08:05.170 --> 08:08.850
now obviously with isn't the only thing we can enemy.

08:08.860 --> 08:16.180
Let's do color so let's say we want the color or I'm sorry the background color color would be the text.

08:16.210 --> 08:23.510
So we want background color and let's set that to red and we'll go ahead and save.

08:23.620 --> 08:28.290
Now not only is it going to extend to 600 pixels but it's going to turn to red.

08:28.330 --> 08:34.630
It's going to go through all the color the whole color system and it's going to go from white to red.

08:34.720 --> 08:42.840
Let's see another thing we could do is it's position so let's actually let's give this a position of

08:43.470 --> 08:44.470
relative.

08:44.670 --> 08:50.520
Because remember when we add position relative we can use parameters like top bottom left right.

08:50.550 --> 08:52.620
So what I'll do is say from

08:55.800 --> 09:05.790
top zero So basically its default position and then two we're gonna end up at let's say from the top

09:05.930 --> 09:09.020
we want to go down three hundred pixels.

09:09.240 --> 09:18.520
So let's save and now you can see that it's animating the with the color and also the position moving

09:18.520 --> 09:24.330
it from from 0 from the top down to 300 pixels from the top.

09:24.340 --> 09:30.010
Now like I said there's a shortcut for this so you don't have to have all of these different properties

09:30.010 --> 09:32.540
we can simply use the animation property.

09:32.620 --> 09:37.840
So I'm going to uncommon the delay and I'm going to comment all of these out and I'm going to show you

09:37.840 --> 09:41.110
how we can do this with just one line or just one property.

09:41.110 --> 09:46.710
So going to say animation first parameter here is going to be the name of the animation.

09:46.720 --> 09:53.480
So animator one second is going to be the speed or the the the duration.

09:53.530 --> 09:56.270
So we'll say five seconds.

09:56.620 --> 09:59.590
Next is going to be the fill mode.

09:59.590 --> 10:06.040
So I wanted to stop at the end so we'll do forwards if we wanted to delay we could do that.

10:06.040 --> 10:13.260
We'll do a one second delay and then we can do the timing function so I'll do ease in out.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.140
OK so let's save that.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.040
Wait a second and then it does the same thing.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.270
OK.

10:20.310 --> 10:24.200
So this is just a shorter way to do all this stuff.

10:24.550 --> 10:26.770
So that's it in the next video.

10:26.770 --> 10:30.760
We're going to we're going to still look at key frames but I want to show you how we can add different

10:30.760 --> 10:31.240
points.

10:31.240 --> 10:37.690
We don't have to do just from and to we can actually use percentages in here and we're going to make

10:38.890 --> 10:42.520
an element move around the screen a little bit different points.

10:42.520 --> 10:42.780
All right.

10:42.790 --> 10:44.040
So I'll see you in the next video.
