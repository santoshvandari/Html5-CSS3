00:00.180 --> 00:05.340
All right guys so this is gonna be just a bonus video showing you how I created the very simple news

00:05.340 --> 00:13.320
grid logo and it's this is not true logo design because what I really did is I found an icon on the

00:13.320 --> 00:15.710
Internet and I just added some text to it.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.900
I edited the colors a little bit.

00:18.060 --> 00:24.570
But what this is gonna do is give you a small introduction to Photoshop because photoshop is very beneficial

00:24.850 --> 00:29.910
when you are creating graphics and or even creating mockups stuff like that.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.290
So I just figured I'd add this on and I'm by no means am I like a true graphic designer.

00:36.290 --> 00:42.210
I have a little bit of capabilities but I wouldn't call myself a graphic designer by any means.

00:42.210 --> 00:48.930
So what we're gonna do first is create this is Photoshop S.C. and I'm going to open.

00:48.930 --> 00:54.510
I'm going to create a new file so you guys can't see my menu what I'm going to go to file new and I'm

00:54.510 --> 01:03.090
going to create a new document with the width of six hundred by let's say six hundred with four hundred

01:03.090 --> 01:05.100
height and create.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.930
And let me just bring this over.

01:08.330 --> 01:08.810
OK.

01:08.820 --> 01:14.230
And then I just search google for a global icon and I found this here.

01:14.280 --> 01:22.230
So if I go to search global icon it's going to be this one right here from Carmen's dot Wikimedia dot

01:22.260 --> 01:22.950
org.

01:22.950 --> 01:29.490
Now make sure if you if you're doing this type of thing for a client or for a production Web site make

01:29.490 --> 01:32.310
sure that if you do use an icon like this.

01:32.310 --> 01:39.420
Make sure it's it's it's stock it's free stock image and it's not from another website or anything like

01:39.420 --> 01:43.540
that because you could run into some issues some copyright issues.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.080
So I'm going to go ahead and just save this image

01:48.900 --> 01:52.640
and then I'm going to drag it into my Photoshop image.

01:52.650 --> 02:01.780
I can actually just take this and bring it right in like that and let's resize this so we'll do like

02:02.280 --> 02:07.470
like that and this isn't gonna be the exact image that we use but this is how I did it.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.950
So going to choose this tool right here which allows me to move things around so I'll move this over

02:11.950 --> 02:18.760
here and let's choose the text tool right here and just click in there and I'm going to say news you

02:18.760 --> 02:24.460
guys can't see probably can't see that so small I'll increase in a second but I'm I'm typing news grid

02:25.210 --> 02:33.370
and we can change the the the size of the font up here aren't sure exactly what size I use.

02:33.370 --> 02:42.020
Let's highlight this and 72 is the largest we can choose here but you can put in whatever whatever point

02:42.020 --> 02:43.240
you want.

02:43.730 --> 02:49.940
So let's bring this over and I don't think this machine has the exact font that I used but of course

02:49.940 --> 02:57.170
you could go through the fonts if I just go up here and just move the mouse wheel it will show me all

02:57.170 --> 02:59.450
the different fonts that I can use.

02:59.450 --> 03:06.500
So we'll just choose like again this isn't going to be the same exact logo but we'll choose see

03:10.230 --> 03:15.710
something that's kind of square we'll just use that I guess.

03:15.710 --> 03:16.030
All right.

03:16.040 --> 03:23.800
So you find a font and let's see we have a color that we want to use which is that red color.

03:23.810 --> 03:28.410
So I'm going to click on the palette right here and just kind of guess.

03:28.640 --> 03:34.030
So it was like a darker red so something see something like that.

03:34.510 --> 03:43.460
So click okay and let's highlight grid and then click this color up this box up here which is the actual

03:43.460 --> 03:46.130
text color and I can choose from here.

03:46.130 --> 03:49.360
I could have just did that but I wanted it in my palette over here.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.230
But you'll see it turns into an eyedropper when I hover over it and if I click it will change the color

03:54.230 --> 03:55.800
to that.

03:55.940 --> 03:56.230
All right.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.660
So that's the text now for the the globe here.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.770
I want these four inner squares to be red.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.080
I wanted to be this color.

04:05.240 --> 04:14.280
So I'm going to grab the wand tool right here and I'm going to click actually see over here in our layers.

04:14.280 --> 04:19.310
I probably should have explained the layers I'm going to deselect with control D but we have layers.

04:19.410 --> 04:24.660
So we have the texts we have the actual icon and we have the background and we can remove the background

04:24.660 --> 04:29.550
with this little eye right here so we can remove that we're gonna want to do that before we export the

04:29.550 --> 04:31.500
file as a PMG.

04:31.530 --> 04:38.130
Now in PND you can have a transparent background like this but J pegs you can't.

04:38.150 --> 04:44.340
So if you want a transparent background and not a white or solid color then make sure you export as

04:44.340 --> 04:49.200
PMG or gift Jeff whatever you want to however you want to say it.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.730
People say it in different ways but gifts are are not as high quality as PND are.

04:55.410 --> 04:55.770
All right.

04:55.770 --> 04:59.820
So we're just going to leave the background for now just so we can kind of see what we're doing.

04:59.970 --> 05:07.550
But I'm gonna go and highlight the globe icon here and again choose the one tool.

05:07.560 --> 05:13.750
And I'm going to click in here and you'll see the little the moving bars around the box here.

05:13.770 --> 05:15.000
That means it's selected.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.710
Now I want to select all four.

05:16.710 --> 05:22.180
So I'm going to hold down shift and click this one this one in this one.

05:22.180 --> 05:22.460
OK.

05:22.470 --> 05:29.490
And then I'm going to go over to my brush tool which is this one right here and see actually you know

05:29.490 --> 05:32.980
what I think we have to raster arises first.

05:33.090 --> 05:35.250
Yes the CIA can't do anything.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.590
We have to rationalize this.

05:36.590 --> 05:43.080
So we're going to go over to the layer and right click and say raster I's layer and now we can color

05:43.080 --> 05:49.320
it and noticed that it's only coloring within the selected parameters.

05:49.410 --> 05:54.780
And you can if you right click with the brush tool you can make it bigger so it can make it bigger like

05:54.780 --> 05:55.290
that.

05:55.290 --> 05:58.110
So now every all the four boxes are colored in.

05:58.260 --> 06:00.530
I'm going to d select with control D.

06:00.870 --> 06:01.620
And that's it.

06:02.370 --> 06:02.670
OK.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.360
So pretty simple.

06:04.560 --> 06:12.120
Now I also have the the light version of it so that it can go on a dark background because if I take

06:12.120 --> 06:17.730
this background and this is going to be locked by default the background so you have to double click

06:17.730 --> 06:18.800
and just click Okay.

06:18.810 --> 06:24.360
And now it's unlocked and we could take the brush and color this if we wanted to.

06:24.480 --> 06:29.670
But I'm just going to double click and it opens up the layer style panel and from here I'm going to

06:29.670 --> 06:33.030
choose color overlay and then we can actually choose a color.

06:33.030 --> 06:37.920
I'm just going to make it really dark like our footer is because that's where we put the light version

06:38.330 --> 06:40.010
and click Okay.

06:40.140 --> 06:40.440
All right.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.670
Now that doesn't look too good it's just it's too dark there's no contrast.

06:44.670 --> 06:51.930
So what I'll do is over here you can see the folder icon I'm going to create a new folder by default.

06:51.930 --> 06:57.560
It's called Group 1 but I'm going to rename it double click rename it to standard.

06:59.250 --> 07:06.510
And I'm going to move my two layers the icon in the news grid the text into that standard folder.

07:06.510 --> 07:06.780
All right.

07:06.780 --> 07:09.040
Now if I click the eye here I can toggle it.

07:09.810 --> 07:16.300
OK now I'm going to create another folder down here.

07:16.350 --> 07:17.960
Make sure it's not in the standard.

07:17.970 --> 07:22.680
And I'm going to call this one light all right.

07:22.680 --> 07:26.140
And then what I want to do is duplicate both of these.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.880
The news the text in the global icon.

07:28.890 --> 07:34.680
So I'm going to right click and I'm going to say duplicate layers and you can name them if you want.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.810
I'm just going to click OK.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.710
And they're just going to be called copy.

07:37.770 --> 07:40.980
And now let's move this into the light folder.

07:40.980 --> 07:41.430
Ok.

07:41.430 --> 07:44.690
And then I'm going to take the standard folder and just click the I.

07:44.690 --> 07:45.780
So it's not showing.

07:45.780 --> 07:52.470
So now it's just showing that the logo and or the icon in the text that are in the light folder.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.470
And now I want to make these light.

07:54.480 --> 08:02.570
So the text is easy I can just choose the text tool highlight news click on this and make it white.

08:03.010 --> 08:04.250
Click OK.

08:04.260 --> 08:11.250
And then for the icon I'm going to make sure that it's selected over here in the layer panel and grab

08:11.250 --> 08:12.310
the wand.

08:12.570 --> 08:16.690
And I want to select apps.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.930
Let's see.

08:18.010 --> 08:18.400
There we go.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.770
So I want to select in there.

08:19.780 --> 08:26.170
I'm actually going to zoom in so the microscope here and just zoom in and then click the wand and hold

08:26.170 --> 08:27.880
shift.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.950
That's not the one that's the color picker.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.850
We're going to hold shift and just click in each of these

08:39.990 --> 08:40.450
OK.

08:40.460 --> 08:46.660
And then what I'll do is choose the brush tool and I'm going to change the color.

08:46.670 --> 08:47.420
Now this.

08:47.420 --> 08:51.470
We have two colors here you can see the blue I'm just going to switch these just so I have that red

08:51.470 --> 08:53.720
one as a backup.

08:53.810 --> 08:59.060
I'm going to change this to white and that's going to be the color of the brush and I'll just go ahead

08:59.060 --> 09:00.630
and fill that in.

09:01.230 --> 09:06.590
It's only going to fill in watch what's selected and they'll do control D to D select and then let's

09:06.590 --> 09:07.150
zoom out.

09:07.150 --> 09:09.840
We'll just say we want to say 100 percent.

09:09.980 --> 09:14.830
And that's the actual logo OK so that's basically what I did.

09:14.910 --> 09:20.120
And then we can take the crop tool and crop this image.

09:20.220 --> 09:24.630
So basically we can just select around it like that.

09:24.630 --> 09:31.140
We can adjust it and let's right click and say crop.

09:31.570 --> 09:31.870
All right.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.030
So now the image is only this big.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.920
And we have the light.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.940
If I click the little icon and click standard we have our standard.

09:39.940 --> 09:43.600
Now we're gonna want to remove the background so we'll click that.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.800
And now we have our standard and our light.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.170
OK.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.550
Now let's save the standard.

09:48.550 --> 09:52.350
So I'm going to go to file.

09:52.360 --> 09:58.790
Now you could do well just to save as much as I don't want to make this too confusing.

09:58.880 --> 10:05.270
So let's go to save as and you can see that by default that's it's getting saved as a PSA D OK but I'm

10:05.270 --> 10:10.280
going to call this logo and I don't want it to be a PSC that's a photoshop file meaning that it will

10:10.280 --> 10:12.000
include all these layers and stuff.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.570
But we can't use that inside of a web page.

10:14.720 --> 10:19.100
So I'm just going to choose from here P and G.

10:19.100 --> 10:19.430
All right.

10:19.430 --> 10:22.120
And then I'll save this too.

10:22.370 --> 10:31.480
We'll just save it too I guess my desktop and we're gonna get this PMG options we're gonna just click

10:31.480 --> 10:32.700
OK here.

10:32.710 --> 10:32.940
All right.

10:32.950 --> 10:34.870
So that saves the regular logo.

10:34.870 --> 10:36.580
Now let's click the light.

10:36.580 --> 10:44.320
And same thing file save as and I'm going to change the nickname this logo underscore light and I'm

10:44.320 --> 10:48.880
going to choose PSG for this as well.

10:48.940 --> 10:49.720
OK.

10:49.930 --> 10:50.730
And that's it.

10:50.740 --> 10:59.360
Now if I close or minimize this and just get rid of all this stuff don't save and then I can show you.

10:59.380 --> 11:06.560
Let me just bring over what I saved so we have our logo light and we have our logo PMG.

11:06.610 --> 11:06.850
All right.

11:06.850 --> 11:13.960
And if I just open this with preview we just have just a standard image that we can include in our web

11:13.960 --> 11:15.060
page.

11:15.070 --> 11:15.330
OK.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.640
So I just wanted to kind of go through that little process.

11:18.640 --> 11:26.140
It's not really something that you know is is needed to know to build Web sites but if you want to get

11:26.140 --> 11:34.330
into editing images maybe creating graphics and stuff like that or just maybe just text logos photoshop

11:34.330 --> 11:35.100
is great for that.

11:35.100 --> 11:41.050
There's also gimp which is an open source tool that is very similar to Photoshop.

11:41.050 --> 11:45.140
You also have Adobe XDR you have sketch Fig.

11:45.160 --> 11:50.800
There's there's a lot of different graphic design programs out there so you know fine find one that

11:50.800 --> 11:56.890
fits fits you and you know it was pretty easy for you to pick up but I just wanted to throw that video

11:56.890 --> 11:57.270
in there.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.380
Hopefully guys enjoyed it and that's it.

11:59.380 --> 11:59.830
Thanks.
