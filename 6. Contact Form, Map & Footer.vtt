WEBVTT

00:00.230 --> 00:04.190
OK so now we're gonna work on the contact section which does have a Google map.

00:04.200 --> 00:09.060
We'll probably get to it in this video would if not then we'll we'll get to it in the next one because

00:09.060 --> 00:10.530
I do want to do the form first.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.050
So let's go down to the bottom here.

00:13.050 --> 00:22.050
We'll add another comment for section of contact and let's do a section tag giving an idea of contact

00:23.220 --> 00:30.840
and we're going to have basically I call this contact section is going to be a flex container.

00:30.840 --> 00:36.080
And then the map and the form are gonna be the Flex items.

00:36.070 --> 00:42.750
So the first one will be the form so I'll give it a class of its to contact dash form.

00:43.620 --> 00:48.690
So this will have the form in it and then I'm gonna do a class of map.

00:48.690 --> 00:52.400
Now the Google map that nothing goes inside of here.

00:52.410 --> 00:55.630
Everything is basically done through javascript.

00:55.650 --> 00:59.000
OK so we'll have to look into that after.

00:59.190 --> 01:00.800
But let's add the form for now.

01:00.810 --> 01:09.610
So I'm actually going to also add class of B G dash primary which I don't believe we've done yet but

01:09.610 --> 01:14.560
this is where we have the green background the primary color as the background.

01:14.860 --> 01:19.670
And then I'm gonna do P2 which will give padding all around.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.380
So inside here let's do an H two.

01:22.390 --> 01:29.920
Let's use our M heading class and we'll say contact us.

01:30.470 --> 01:43.130
And then inside the paragraph will say please use the form below to contact us okay.

01:43.140 --> 01:45.210
And then let's do a form.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.600
We don't need an action we're not actually submitting it.

01:48.600 --> 01:54.200
And then here we'll do a class of form dash group which wraps the label in the input.

01:54.840 --> 02:06.510
So label safe for name and then let's do an input with the type of text and the name will be name I.D.

02:06.510 --> 02:10.860
We'll be name and then let's also add a placeholder

02:13.970 --> 02:16.360
and we'll say enter name.

02:17.480 --> 02:17.850
OK.

02:17.880 --> 02:24.480
So if we take a look at that it can see it's very ugly looking for now and then we'll to copy this form

02:24.480 --> 02:26.340
group what's copy this down.

02:26.350 --> 02:30.350
See two three four for these.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.640
The second one is gonna be the email.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.960
So let's change the four attribute to email.

02:35.970 --> 02:37.880
We'll change this to email.

02:38.190 --> 02:49.860
The type will change to email the name and the I.D. email and we'll say enter email for the place holder

02:50.320 --> 02:55.120
K and then we're gonna have phone number.

02:55.200 --> 03:04.620
So this is gonna be phone and let's see the type we'll just keep that as text the name is gonna be phone

03:05.580 --> 03:10.650
I.D. phone and then we'll say enter

03:14.290 --> 03:17.030
a phone number.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.980
And then this last one is gonna be a message.

03:18.980 --> 03:27.660
So for message label message and it's gonna be a text area instead of an input.

03:27.680 --> 03:34.460
So I'm going to get rid of the input in the type and I'm gonna replace that with text area and we need

03:34.460 --> 03:41.420
to add an ending text area tag as well and we'll say enter message for the place holder will change

03:41.420 --> 03:46.590
the name and the I.D. to message as well.

03:46.730 --> 03:47.080
OK.

03:47.090 --> 03:49.960
Now we only we just need to do a submit.

03:49.970 --> 04:01.760
So let's go under the div and let's do an input with the type of submit and the value is just the text

04:01.760 --> 04:03.520
that's gonna read so we'll just say.

04:03.680 --> 04:12.030
I will say send for the value and then I just want a class of B T N and I'm also gonna make this dark

04:12.050 --> 04:17.810
remember we have that B10 and dark class that we created in our C Ss so let's save that and it should

04:17.810 --> 04:19.620
look like this.

04:19.640 --> 04:19.950
OK.

04:19.970 --> 04:26.690
So now let's add the styling for the form we also want to add that big primary right here because we

04:26.690 --> 04:28.610
don't have that as a class.

04:28.820 --> 04:40.130
So let's go up to our utilities go right under big dark and say B G primary in background is gonna be

04:40.130 --> 04:41.870
that this green color.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.050
OK.

04:44.060 --> 04:46.540
And then color is gonna be white.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.930
So that's big primary.

04:50.930 --> 05:04.390
Now down below down at the bottom under the clients section know we'll do a c section clients that's

05:04.520 --> 05:06.260
a section

05:08.480 --> 05:11.090
contact.

05:11.090 --> 05:11.740
Let's see.

05:11.750 --> 05:22.770
So are the contact itself the idea of contact that's gonna be our flex so let's say display flex Kay

05:26.720 --> 05:28.760
now the map.

05:28.880 --> 05:36.770
Let's see I want the contact form and the map by default to have a flex one so that there even when

05:36.770 --> 05:41.560
it's on a wide screen I'm going to change it so that the form is smaller and the map is bigger.

05:41.570 --> 05:48.680
But for now let's take contact in the class of map.

05:48.920 --> 05:55.910
Actually what we can do is just add them both to put a comma and we'll say take contact in the class

05:55.910 --> 06:03.740
of contact form and let's say flex one for both.

06:03.740 --> 06:07.570
So now it's just even now it's style.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.880
The the inputs to label stuff like that.

06:10.940 --> 06:20.600
So the form group so contact and then contact form and then the form group.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.880
I'm just gonna add a margin so that they're separated a bit.

06:24.910 --> 06:29.300
So let's do zero point seven five rems.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.220
OK.

06:30.290 --> 06:34.340
And then we'll do the label because I want the label to display block.

06:34.340 --> 06:35.540
Right now it's in line.

06:35.540 --> 06:39.960
You can see it's you know it's to the left of the input but I want it to be on top.

06:40.010 --> 06:41.270
So let's take.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.080
Contact.

06:43.430 --> 06:53.210
Contact form label and let's display as a block level elements of a save that you'll see that now it's

06:53.210 --> 06:54.560
on top.

06:54.620 --> 06:54.950
All right.

06:54.950 --> 06:59.120
And then for the input in the text area so we'll see.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.920
Contact.

07:02.450 --> 07:08.770
Contact form input as well.

07:12.220 --> 07:16.880
As the text area.

07:17.230 --> 07:20.550
Let's go ahead and set a width of 100 percent.

07:20.560 --> 07:26.770
So it goes all the way across and let's add some padding say zero point five.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.490
And there we go.

07:27.490 --> 07:31.920
So that looks pretty decent now.

07:31.990 --> 07:32.290
Yeah.

07:32.290 --> 07:33.520
Now we'll work on the map.

07:34.510 --> 07:38.740
So what we're gonna have to do is you can have to log into your Google account and then I want you to

07:38.740 --> 07:46.240
just type in search Google console not the search console we want the cloud console because we're working

07:46.240 --> 07:53.140
with a Google map that means that we need an API key because it has to make a request to the Google

07:53.140 --> 07:56.660
servers to get the location and all that stuff.

07:56.740 --> 08:01.550
So let's let's go.

08:01.630 --> 08:02.980
You gonna have to have a project.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.270
OK.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.260
Now I already have one called dev one.

08:05.260 --> 08:09.610
If you don't have a project just do new project call it whatever you want.

08:09.610 --> 08:16.320
Once you have a project if you click over here an API and services it's going to show you.

08:17.590 --> 08:23.510
Let's see right here we want to say enable API is in services and it's going to show you all the different

08:23.510 --> 08:26.490
Google services which there's tons of.

08:26.870 --> 08:33.830
We want maps right here maps javascript API.

08:33.830 --> 08:38.790
OK so you weren't to want to click that mine's already enabled you'll probably see a button that says

08:38.790 --> 08:45.270
enable make sure you click that and then you should see something like this.

08:45.270 --> 08:46.770
Make sure it's enabled.

08:46.770 --> 08:53.460
Mine is as you can see I have a disable option and then you want to go to credentials and you want to

08:53.460 --> 08:57.360
create an API key so let's see.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.970
I mean you can see mine right here.

09:02.780 --> 09:04.880
Where would we go here.

09:04.890 --> 09:11.470
I mean I already have one but you should see something like create new API key I believe.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.560
Credentials API manager.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.190
Here we go.

09:14.700 --> 09:23.520
So create credentials API key and it'll give you something that looks like this and you can restricted

09:23.520 --> 09:27.010
to certain domains and stuff but we're not going to do that just go ahead and save it.

09:27.510 --> 09:30.990
So now you should have an API key.

09:31.340 --> 09:33.580
I'm just going to see you.

09:33.780 --> 09:39.610
I just want to check which one of these I actually used.

09:42.050 --> 09:43.780
Let's see where is it.

09:47.350 --> 09:48.180
Yes.

09:48.950 --> 09:49.270
All right.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.160
So I use this one here so you can actually copy it if you click this it'll copy it to your click clipboard

09:55.490 --> 10:01.010
and for now I'm going to go into my index each team Tim Allen I'm just gonna put this inside of a comment

10:01.010 --> 10:04.640
down here just so I have it all right.

10:04.640 --> 10:12.330
Now next thing we're gonna want to do is go ahead and search for Google Map docs.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.620
And click on the first link here the overview.

10:16.710 --> 10:19.460
And this basically tells us what we need to do.

10:19.590 --> 10:27.600
So we need to add a script tag so a script tag just includes a javascript file and we're including the

10:27.660 --> 10:29.150
javascript maps file.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.510
But we also need to put in our API key.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.210
All right.

10:33.210 --> 10:36.450
And then we need to add a little bit of JavaScript.

10:36.450 --> 10:42.360
Ours is going to be it's going to resemble this but instead of putting it inside of script tags right

10:42.390 --> 10:47.950
in our each team Al we're going to put it in that main J main dot J S file that we created.

10:48.090 --> 10:50.730
And notice that they have a div with the idea of map.

10:50.730 --> 10:54.470
We used a class but it doesn't really matter we can target a div or a class.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.720
And that's where the map goes.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.860
And then you can see up here they set the height to 100 percent because it's like it's like a background

11:01.860 --> 11:07.830
image it needs to have a height or it needs to have some kind of content in it to actually display.

11:07.860 --> 11:12.230
So what we're gonna do is just copy this right here this script.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.430
We're gonna go back into our H team.

11:14.430 --> 11:16.650
I'll go right above the body.

11:16.650 --> 11:20.940
We're gonna pace that in and where it says your API key in all caps.

11:20.940 --> 11:26.430
You're gonna grab your API key and just put it right in there so when it controls C to copy it and then

11:26.430 --> 11:30.320
control V to pace that right in there.

11:30.440 --> 11:30.810
All right.

11:30.870 --> 11:42.720
Now we also need to include our main dot J S file so we're gonna go right above it and put in a script

11:42.720 --> 11:43.680
tag.

11:43.680 --> 11:49.270
So if we do script and then a colon and then S.R. C that will add a source attribute.

11:49.380 --> 11:49.690
OK.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.860
Just like an image when you have an image you point it to a source.

11:52.860 --> 11:53.150
Right.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.900
Well with a javascript file we also use source.

11:57.120 --> 12:02.910
So we're going to point to the J S folder so we can do.

12:03.150 --> 12:03.370
Yeah.

12:03.390 --> 12:12.260
We'll just do J ust slash main Todd J.S. now I mean we're not talking too much about JavaScript in this

12:12.260 --> 12:19.900
course but just remember when you include javascript you use source when you include CSX you use a traffic.

12:19.980 --> 12:20.260
OK.

12:20.290 --> 12:24.560
And when I know that some people when they're starting out they get that confused they'll do a they'll

12:24.560 --> 12:29.930
do link and then source like that or a script tag within a traffic.

12:29.930 --> 12:33.740
Just remember that JavaScript uses the source to attribute.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.300
So that will include the main J S file.

12:37.430 --> 12:47.300
So let's go ahead and save this and then we want to actually go into our main dot J ust file and I'm

12:47.390 --> 12:51.280
I'm gonna actually paste in the javascript and then I'll quickly go over it.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.970
Like I said this is not a javascript course.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.350
I don't really want to get too much into it.

12:57.380 --> 13:02.300
I do have a 21 hour javascript course on you to me if you're interested which I would recommend after

13:02.300 --> 13:03.200
this one.

13:03.470 --> 13:10.470
So I'm going to pace this and you guys can copy this or you can you can get it from the finished project.

13:10.700 --> 13:17.750
And basically what's happening here if we look in the index page Tim Al it's linking to the maps API

13:17.870 --> 13:24.200
and it's it has this callback equals init to map this init map is a function.

13:24.210 --> 13:27.020
OK it's this function here that we're creating.

13:27.020 --> 13:33.410
So it's going to call this in nit map and it is short for initialize and then what we're doing here

13:33.800 --> 13:41.180
is putting in our location which is this is actually called a javascript object and it has a latitude

13:41.210 --> 13:42.620
and longitude.

13:42.620 --> 13:48.740
Now this this latitude and longitude is actually is centred in Boston Massachusetts.

13:48.800 --> 13:54.150
If you want your map to be somewhere else you can get the latitude and longitude from from there.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.390
And there certain sites you can do that with.

13:56.390 --> 14:06.260
So let's just say like get the latitude and longitude from an address and if you go to lat long dot

14:06.290 --> 14:10.570
net you can put in any address here like it or anything.

14:10.570 --> 14:12.170
We could just say like New York

14:14.890 --> 14:21.700
and find and it'll get us just a random place in New York which you can see here so you could put any

14:21.710 --> 14:26.960
any any latitude and longitude that you want into this object.

14:26.970 --> 14:27.290
OK.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.640
But if we're just going to stick with with Boston Massachusetts.

14:31.180 --> 14:37.010
Now this here is creating what's called a variable called map and we're sending it to a new Google map.

14:37.240 --> 14:42.070
And then this document dot query selector is targeting the class of map.

14:42.120 --> 14:42.420
OK.

14:42.430 --> 14:45.970
Now remember in our index each team Al we have this class of map.

14:46.540 --> 14:52.420
So we're targeting that and that's where we want to insert the map and you can change the zoom level.

14:52.420 --> 14:57.190
So we're going to keep it at 14 but you can lower it if you want or higher it.

14:57.460 --> 15:03.880
And then we're saying the center position is going to be in the location K the location was also put

15:03.880 --> 15:06.770
into a variable which is basically a place holder.

15:06.890 --> 15:10.120
And if you don't understand anything I'm saying don't worry about it.

15:10.420 --> 15:16.030
Down here is we're reporting on marker because we want a marker in that special location.

15:16.030 --> 15:22.420
So we're saying create a new marker and the position should be the location which is this variable.

15:22.570 --> 15:26.440
And the map should show this map.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.550
So hopefully that makes at least a little bit of sense of what's going on here.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.900
I don't expect you to know javascript yet.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.260
So let's save this.

15:35.800 --> 15:42.420
And if we go back to our project this is our project.

15:42.430 --> 15:44.470
We have a map.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.630
OK.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.860
So it's as simple as that.

15:47.980 --> 15:53.200
If that was simple maybe that was really hard if you're just getting into this if you're if you're already

15:53.200 --> 15:59.230
familiar with JavaScript and stuff and you've been watching like tutorials and this is probably brutal

15:59.230 --> 16:05.610
for you to watch because it's very it's this at some point this is going to be very simple for you.

16:05.950 --> 16:07.260
But yeah we have our map.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.460
We have our form so good.

16:09.550 --> 16:12.760
Now I think that we can get our footer in here.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.320
That's the last thing on the page.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.240
There's nothing not really anything to it.

16:16.240 --> 16:25.120
So let's head back to index H Tim Al and under our section here let's put in our footer going to use

16:25.120 --> 16:26.500
the footer tag.

16:26.500 --> 16:31.270
And I'm also going to give it an idea of main dash footer.

16:31.360 --> 16:31.900
All right.

16:31.900 --> 16:36.270
And then in here we're just going to put a paragraph with a copy right.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.860
So we'll say copyright.

16:37.900 --> 16:45.940
We'll put our Ampersand copy semicolon remember that we'll say twenty not twenty ninety one be long

16:45.940 --> 16:58.510
gone by then copyright twenty nineteen edge ledger and we'll say all rights reserved for our text and

16:58.510 --> 17:04.630
then actually want to put that in a container so that it stays in the middle so we'll just move this

17:04.990 --> 17:10.560
up into the container and then I want to add some extra classes to this footer.

17:11.380 --> 17:23.110
So let's do b g dash dark and let's do text dash center and then P Y dash one to put the padding on

17:23.110 --> 17:31.940
the top and the bottom and we'll save that and there we go that looks good so we're gonna go ahead and

17:31.940 --> 17:37.970
stop here and in the next video we're gonna add our smooth scrolling which is also javascript.

17:37.970 --> 17:39.530
I'll go over very briefly.

17:39.590 --> 17:43.970
We'll be using something called J query which we'll talk about a little bit but right now I can hit

17:43.970 --> 17:51.920
what brings us down to the what the WHO the menu does cover some of it because the menu is basically

17:51.920 --> 17:55.540
fixed the rest of the site doesn't pay attention to this.

17:55.550 --> 18:03.530
The spacing here so it does start like up here but we can actually kind of work that out with the with

18:03.530 --> 18:04.850
the j query.

18:04.850 --> 18:05.120
All right.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.470
So I'll see you in the next video.
