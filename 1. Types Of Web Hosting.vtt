WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:03.240
All right so we've built a couple of small projects on our local machine.

00:03.240 --> 00:07.110
Now I want to start looking at how to actually get a Web site online.

00:07.140 --> 00:11.250
And we talked a little bit about this in the beginning of the course you're usually going to register

00:11.250 --> 00:17.010
a domain name and then by some kind of hosting account although many hosting accounts do include a free

00:17.010 --> 00:18.020
domain name.

00:18.030 --> 00:22.860
So in this video I just want to go over the different types of hosting there are as well as the pricing

00:22.860 --> 00:23.970
points.

00:23.970 --> 00:29.010
So these are the most common types of hosting we have shared hosting VPN us which is a virtual private

00:29.010 --> 00:34.950
server dedicated server reseller hosting cloud hosting and static hosting.

00:34.980 --> 00:38.810
So we're gonna go over each of these and talk about what they are.

00:38.820 --> 00:45.360
So aside from from free tiers of static hosting which I'll get to in a bit shared hosting is definitely

00:45.360 --> 00:51.660
the cheapest ranging from around three dollars to 15 dollars per month although a lot of times you'll

00:51.660 --> 00:57.750
have to pay by the year so it'll be around 70 bucks 70 to 100 bucks a year which isn't bad and shared

00:57.750 --> 01:05.490
hosting means that you get one of many accounts on the same server and on the same operating system

01:05.490 --> 01:06.470
environment.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.310
And this is suitable for most small Web sites so anything that we build in this course would be just

01:11.310 --> 01:14.700
fine on a shared host in terms of data and size.

01:14.700 --> 01:20.100
However they usually restrict bandwidth so if you have a site where you're expecting you know tens of

01:20.100 --> 01:25.440
thousands of users every day it's probably not the best thing you probably want to go with with something

01:25.440 --> 01:33.300
of a higher tier but if it's some local business like a flower shop or something like that in most cases

01:33.300 --> 01:34.140
it's gonna be fine.

01:34.140 --> 01:40.080
I built Web sites for local businesses for a long time and I would say 90 percent of them use the shared

01:40.080 --> 01:41.500
web host.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.270
So this is definitely probably where you're going to want to start I should say probably where you're

01:45.270 --> 01:49.320
going to start or maybe static hosting which I'll get to in a little bit.

01:50.310 --> 01:57.030
And this is this is what we'll be doing in this section we're gonna set up a shared host shared hosted

01:57.030 --> 02:03.960
account within motion which is a great service great company that I've used for years now most of these

02:03.960 --> 02:09.090
these types of accounts are managed and they include email servers so you'll be able to set up your

02:09.090 --> 02:16.350
email with your domain name you get a control panel to view analytics create FTB accounts you can upload

02:16.350 --> 02:22.890
files you can even create databases a lot of them come with like you know one click installs for things

02:22.890 --> 02:29.820
like WordPress so shared hosting is great for small local businesses and like I said I suggest in motion

02:29.850 --> 02:32.330
but there's also hosted gator blue hosted these.

02:32.330 --> 02:36.980
These are some other companies that I've worked with that are really good as well.

02:37.020 --> 02:37.350
All right.

02:37.350 --> 02:44.720
So next up we have VPN or virtual private server and this is a step up from shared hosting you're going

02:44.730 --> 02:53.120
to get a it's basically an account that's on a physical machine but it's a virtualize environment.

02:53.130 --> 02:59.280
OK so with shared hosting you have the same environment you just have different accounts on a VPN you

02:59.280 --> 03:04.400
have you have less people on the same server and they're all their own environments.

03:04.410 --> 03:10.860
So it's more secure you know it's less prone to issues from other accounts things like that you also

03:10.860 --> 03:17.400
get much more access with a shared account you usually can't log in through SSL H or through the shell

03:17.580 --> 03:23.430
as a route user and with a VPN yes you have much more control you can log in his route you can install

03:23.430 --> 03:29.790
things in these range from usually range from about twenty to one hundred dollars per month and obviously

03:29.790 --> 03:36.630
different packages have different disk space and bandwidth restrictions just like a shared host a VPN

03:36.750 --> 03:41.820
is great if you plan on having more than one web site you can actually create your own smaller shared

03:41.820 --> 03:47.760
accounts with their own separate control panels and you could even sell shared accounts but a reseller

03:47.760 --> 03:51.410
is better for that which I'll talk about next.

03:51.450 --> 03:58.830
So a reseller account is very similar to a VPN Yes except it's more geared towards reselling shared

03:58.830 --> 04:01.740
hosting to third parties.

04:01.740 --> 04:08.610
So you'll basically get a panel where you can create and terminate shared accounts and you can sell

04:08.610 --> 04:14.760
those to two users on your Web site and most reseller packages come bundled with a piece of software

04:14.760 --> 04:18.900
called W. HCM s which is used for billing.

04:19.080 --> 04:24.210
You can actually make it so when a user pays through the system which you can integrate into your Web

04:24.210 --> 04:28.470
site a new account gets set up on your reseller server.

04:28.470 --> 04:28.910
OK.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.250
And then they'll get sent an email and they'll be able to log in and all this.

04:32.250 --> 04:38.790
I actually did this for about three or four years when I had my web dev company but I wouldn't suggest

04:38.790 --> 04:41.390
doing it unless unless you really know what you're doing.

04:41.400 --> 04:49.900
You know you need to really know about things like DNS and and dev ops and stuff like that all right.

04:49.910 --> 04:55.430
So a dedicated server is an actual physical machine sitting in a data center that you rent out.

04:55.430 --> 05:02.240
So as opposed to just basically having an account on a server with other people you you actually not

05:02.270 --> 05:04.190
own but rent the machine.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.110
And these are definitely the most expensive.

05:06.110 --> 05:09.340
They range anywhere from one hundred which is very very cheap.

05:09.350 --> 05:15.460
You're lucky to find a dedicated server for 100 bucks to four hundred and even more than that.

05:15.530 --> 05:22.460
Now these are great for large sites and applications that are going to have tons of users.

05:22.460 --> 05:26.870
You get full freedom you can usually install whatever operating system you want.

05:26.870 --> 05:27.620
Stuff like that.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.890
Most likely Linux Linux rules.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.830
The hosting world.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.810
So most of the time your servers will run Linux.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.230
Some some distribution of Linux.

05:36.260 --> 05:42.140
The downside is they're much harder to manage and in most cases you'll probably have like a designated

05:42.380 --> 05:47.600
dev ops person on a team managing a dedicated server.

05:47.600 --> 05:47.890
All right.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.420
So next is cloud hosting.

05:49.430 --> 05:53.990
And this is more for web applications more so than just static web sites.

05:54.020 --> 06:00.200
So if you build something like a social network or an e-commerce site using a language like Python PJ

06:00.240 --> 06:04.900
P or something like no J.S. cloud hosting is great for that.

06:04.910 --> 06:11.750
It's basically having multiple servers working together and it's extremely powerful and scalable Digital

06:11.750 --> 06:14.780
Ocean is one of my favorite providers for this.

06:14.780 --> 06:18.410
The downside is you have to know a lot to manage cloud hosting.

06:18.410 --> 06:22.730
You need to know a bunch of Linux terminal commands.

06:22.790 --> 06:29.120
You need to know how to setup things like engine X servers firewalls and it gets really really advanced

06:29.120 --> 06:34.180
and way beyond you know what we're doing in this course.

06:34.190 --> 06:34.420
All right.

06:34.430 --> 06:39.890
So lastly we have static hosting which is fairly new and a good example of this is net lo fi and get

06:39.890 --> 06:41.250
hub pages.

06:41.360 --> 06:46.460
We're actually going to be deploying to nullify a little later which is a fantastic service they offer

06:46.460 --> 06:51.890
hosting but they also have additional features like server list functions if you want to add some dynamic

06:51.890 --> 06:58.580
functionality and also contact form submission which is really cool and they're used for both front

06:58.580 --> 07:05.670
end applications and static web sites including sites that want to have backend services Natalya find

07:05.690 --> 07:08.140
GitHub pages both have free tiers.

07:08.180 --> 07:13.880
So if you just want to host your site without having the bells and whistles of a control panel you know

07:13.880 --> 07:17.610
e-mail and all that you can do that for free.

07:17.660 --> 07:23.240
But if he I mean you could still have email on that domain you'll just most likely have to have it's

07:23.540 --> 07:27.110
connected to some other service some kind of email service.

07:27.170 --> 07:34.640
Now you will need to know at least the basics of get which is a version control system to deploy to

07:34.640 --> 07:37.210
either notify or get hub pages.

07:37.430 --> 07:38.750
But we're going to do that later.

07:38.750 --> 07:44.510
I'm going to teach you some of the basic commands and it's really not that difficult.

07:44.540 --> 07:44.840
All right.

07:44.840 --> 07:51.440
So for now what we're gonna do is jump in and we're going to upload our edge ledger Web site to in motion

07:51.440 --> 07:57.680
hosting to a shared account and they'll show you how to create FCP how to upload your files and all

07:57.680 --> 07:58.520
that good stuff.
