00:00.270 --> 00:05.540
All right guys in this video we're going to take a look at CSX variables also called Custom properties.

00:05.560 --> 00:09.180
K so in documentation you might see them as custom properties.

00:09.180 --> 00:13.970
But most people call them variables because that's what they are they're just place holders for values.

00:14.040 --> 00:22.160
So let's create a new file called 06 underscore variables dot h t a mouth and we'll put in our boiler

00:22.160 --> 00:23.480
plate.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.600
It's a C assess

00:27.690 --> 00:30.900
variables and put our style

00:33.390 --> 00:38.350
to just close up and in the body.

00:38.550 --> 00:39.780
We're not going to have too much here.

00:39.780 --> 00:43.350
We're going to put a header and the header will have an H one.

00:43.350 --> 00:52.350
We'll just say See assess variables and outside the header let's do a container and it's going to have

00:52.350 --> 00:53.290
to Divs.

00:53.340 --> 00:58.570
So Class of box it's to a class of box dash and then money sign.

00:58.770 --> 01:05.100
And then let's times that by two and enter and each one is going to have let's do an h three we'll just

01:05.100 --> 01:09.150
say heading paragraph will do Lorem 15.

01:09.160 --> 01:14.250
Doesn't really matter what the content is it's going to copy the H3 in the paragraph and put that in

01:14.250 --> 01:15.820
this div as well.

01:16.120 --> 01:21.530
And let's just move this back and open this with live server.

01:21.660 --> 01:26.810
So it should look like this and we're gonna add some some base styling here before we get into variables.

01:27.060 --> 01:31.950
And I know a lot of this stuff is repetitive but it's good to keep typing it out because you get more

01:31.950 --> 01:43.040
familiar with things so we're going to add a reset of so margin zero padding zero and the body.

01:43.210 --> 01:44.730
Want to make it look somewhat decent.

01:44.730 --> 01:55.970
So we're gonna do a font family of Ariel which Ariel was the default font for browsers not Times New

01:55.970 --> 02:00.530
Roman because it just looks horrible or some kind of sans serif font.

02:00.800 --> 02:13.790
So let's do a line height of one point four and let's do a background of light grey.

02:13.990 --> 02:14.260
All right.

02:14.420 --> 02:19.850
So I'm gonna save this now before I move on to styling this other stuff.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.910
I'm gonna show you how to create a variable.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.980
Now you need to define a scope for your variables.

02:26.040 --> 02:30.400
Well actually you can define them right inside here if we wanted to.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.230
I could go right above and I could say dash dash.

02:33.230 --> 02:37.330
This is how you format the variable dash dash and then name it.

02:37.340 --> 02:48.350
So I could say let's say light dash color and set it to F for three times like that and then I could

02:48.350 --> 02:56.210
use the variable right here by using the VAR keyword opening up some parentheses and then putting in

02:56.600 --> 03:03.080
dash dash light color you're seeing V.S. code will actually get a dropdown with with the options.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.180
And if I say we get the same result.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.410
OK.

03:06.410 --> 03:08.840
So this is how you can define a variable.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.920
Now usually you're not going to define it right in the same.

03:12.980 --> 03:16.670
You know right where you're using it that kind of defeats the purpose.

03:16.670 --> 03:24.170
I like to use variables so I have a single place in my CSA in my style sheet that I can update like

03:24.170 --> 03:26.880
primary colors and stuff like that.

03:26.900 --> 03:32.870
So what I'm going to do is just take this just cut that out and then I'm going to go up here.

03:32.870 --> 03:36.100
I'm going to define a scope to define my variable.

03:36.290 --> 03:43.420
Now since I used it in body I could just do body like that and then put in the variable but I'm going

03:43.420 --> 03:44.550
to put it in the root.

03:44.580 --> 03:45.960
What's called the root scope.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.590
So we do colon root.

03:48.730 --> 03:49.150
OK.

03:49.150 --> 03:54.180
So any variable that you create in the root scope you can use anywhere in the style sheet.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.420
So if I save this you can see that this still works.

03:57.560 --> 03:57.880
All right.

03:57.890 --> 04:05.690
Now what I usually use variable variables for is primary color secondary color and then you usually

04:05.690 --> 04:11.330
have some kind of light grey at least at least when I build sites you eyes I have some kind of light

04:11.330 --> 04:17.720
gray sometimes a dark gray sometimes a really like a black almost and I put these into variables because

04:17.720 --> 04:23.540
I might use them over and over and then if you ever want to change it you don't have to go to each instance

04:23.540 --> 04:25.250
of that color and change it.

04:25.340 --> 04:33.730
So let's create a primary color and for the primary color I'm just going to do steel blue.

04:34.310 --> 04:40.280
OK and then let's do a secondary color because usually you'll have kind of a color palette to your UI

04:40.280 --> 04:41.180
or your Web site.

04:41.190 --> 04:49.640
And I'm gonna do sky blue OK so have a primary color a secondary color and a light color and then we're

04:49.640 --> 04:57.590
gonna go down here and add some some more styling so let's go header and for the header I'm going to

04:57.590 --> 05:08.300
set a background color and I want to set that to the variable of primary color.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.910
OK so if I save that we get the color.

05:10.910 --> 05:15.810
I'm also gonna change the text color to white.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.430
And then let's see.

05:18.420 --> 05:28.400
Let's let's text the line to the center and then I'm going to add a bottom border action going to go

05:28.400 --> 05:36.590
right here and I'm going to say border bottom let's do five pixels and then I'm going to use the secondary

05:36.590 --> 05:36.950
color.

05:36.950 --> 05:43.970
So var dash dash secondary color solid and we'll save.

05:43.970 --> 05:44.440
All right.

05:44.440 --> 05:49.400
Now let's do the container the container is actually going to be a flex box.

05:49.790 --> 05:52.790
So we'll see a display flex that has two items in it.

05:52.820 --> 06:00.560
So those are gonna be side by side and then in the container I'm going to add let's see.

06:00.580 --> 06:06.820
Let's do margin auto and then let's add a max with and this is some.

06:06.860 --> 06:12.230
This is something I may put in a variable as well because if you want to for some reason change the

06:12.260 --> 06:17.210
the width of the the interface or the Web site you can easily do that up here.

06:17.210 --> 06:26.210
So I'm actually going to go right here and say Max width and let's set it to eleven hundred pixels and

06:26.210 --> 06:33.200
then we can set that right here by saying var dash dash Max with.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.670
Now if I save it I shouldn't be able to go past eleven hundred pixels and if I wanted to change it I

06:37.670 --> 06:45.000
could just very easily just change it to like 960 and I can see it gets it gets thinner.

06:45.110 --> 06:45.890
OK.

06:45.920 --> 06:56.750
Now the boxes I want to have the the primary color as well so let's go dot box and let's say background

06:58.250 --> 07:05.260
color and we'll set that to var dash dash primary color and let's do the same thing with the border

07:05.270 --> 07:05.810
bottom

07:08.500 --> 07:08.800
so.

07:08.820 --> 07:14.370
Border bottom we're going to set to five pixels.

07:14.990 --> 07:21.430
We're going to use the secondary color and solid k.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.440
Let's change the color to white.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.160
You could even put the text color in a variable if you wanted to.

07:28.160 --> 07:32.500
You can put whatever you want into variables but sometimes it just doesn't make sense.

07:32.510 --> 07:39.320
It really makes sense when you're gonna be reusing it or if it's something major like the width of the

07:39.350 --> 07:45.300
layout or something like that at least in my opinion and let's just add some padding here.

07:45.800 --> 07:54.050
Let's say one room margin one room and we'll save that and you can see that it has the same colors as

07:54.050 --> 07:55.530
the header.

07:55.610 --> 07:55.910
All right.

07:55.940 --> 08:01.790
So what's great about this is if I want to change that let's pretend that this is a whole Web site and

08:01.850 --> 08:04.760
we're using these variables all over the place.

08:04.850 --> 08:10.670
So we have like seven eight nine instances of the primary secondary color like color.

08:10.670 --> 08:13.210
We can now easily change this.

08:13.220 --> 08:24.050
OK so if we wanted to change it to like I don't know dark dark gray and then maybe like light gray or

08:24.050 --> 08:27.380
something like that that might look a little weird but we'll save it.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.420
And now the whole thing changes.

08:29.420 --> 08:36.620
So it's very convenient to use variables for colors and then things like widths and in layout and stuff

08:36.620 --> 08:37.220
like that.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.150
OK.

08:38.180 --> 08:42.970
So another thing that maybe we can do is is the width of the Flex boxes.

08:42.980 --> 08:54.380
So if we actually go up here and let's set dash dash box one with we'll set that to one and then dash

08:54.380 --> 09:09.440
dash box 2 with we'll set that to 2 and then let's add the box one class and we'll say what are we doing

09:09.440 --> 09:16.980
here raising flex so we can save our dash dash box one with.

09:17.150 --> 09:18.150
Copy that down.

09:18.170 --> 09:25.480
Changes to two blocks two ends and save up what I do.

09:25.490 --> 09:28.240
Just delete everything and save.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.410
Now you can see that there is a different layout here.

09:32.420 --> 09:39.160
And now we can easily change this if I wanted to do maybe three here save that that gets that gets bigger.

09:39.160 --> 09:46.190
If I wanted to do maybe one in three here now I can easily change the layout with these variables.

09:46.190 --> 09:49.790
Now everything is in all the variables are defined in the root scope.

09:49.820 --> 10:01.080
But again you can for instance the boxes we want we can say dot box and we can move these into here

10:01.080 --> 10:05.100
since we're not going to be using these variables anywhere else except for the box scope right.

10:05.130 --> 10:08.830
So if I save that that still works.

10:08.880 --> 10:14.400
Now if I move the max width into the box that's not going to work.

10:14.430 --> 10:19.710
So if I stretch to sell you'll see the max with doesn't work anymore because it's in the container.

10:19.710 --> 10:24.020
I could put this in the container scope like I could do dot container and put that in.

10:24.030 --> 10:26.630
But that's something I would I'd keep in the room.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.020
OK.

10:27.030 --> 10:30.920
Because it's like a main just a main part of the site.

10:30.950 --> 10:31.290
All right.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.320
So that's pretty much it.

10:33.330 --> 10:40.830
Guys I mean like I said I mostly use it for primary and secondary colors things like widths but.

10:41.190 --> 10:47.430
Yeah we'll be we'll be using variables throughout the coming projects and that's it.

10:47.430 --> 10:48.750
I will see you in the next video.
