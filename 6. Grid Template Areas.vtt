WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:05.610
All right now we're going to get into a property called GRID template areas which basically allows us

00:05.610 --> 00:10.680
to visually map out the alignment of our elements through CSX.

00:10.710 --> 00:19.340
So let's create a new file here called 0 5 underscore grid underscore what is called grid areas thought

00:19.400 --> 00:27.320
H.

00:28.040 --> 00:28.340
All right.

00:28.370 --> 00:33.620
So I'm going to close that up and I'm going to paste in the body here and just go over it because it's

00:33.620 --> 00:39.690
kind of a lot I don't feel like typing it out but basically we have a main div here.

00:39.710 --> 00:46.080
Let's just push this back like that.

00:46.150 --> 00:46.390
All right.

00:46.420 --> 00:55.100
So we have a did with the class of container that goes around everything and then we have a header which

00:55.100 --> 00:56.200
just has an H1.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.080
We have a section with the class of content.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.620
And inside here there's an age three and a paragraph.

01:02.710 --> 01:10.680
Then we have a set aside which we want to be our sidebar and then there's three boxes and then a footer.

01:10.720 --> 01:17.890
So I just want to lay this out like a very simple Web site where we have the header the main content

01:17.920 --> 01:23.710
the side by the three boxes in the footer and we're gonna do this just using the grid template areas

01:23.710 --> 01:24.850
property.

01:24.850 --> 01:30.280
So let's go up here and actually let's save an open at first.

01:30.280 --> 01:38.410
Everything is just going to be straight down but we're going to set on the container we want to set

01:38.410 --> 01:40.970
a grid.

01:40.970 --> 01:41.340
OK.

01:41.350 --> 01:43.190
So we'll save that.

01:43.270 --> 01:49.020
Now here is where we want to put the grid template areas right in the in the parent.

01:49.030 --> 01:57.730
So template dash areas and we basically like I said we want to map the map this out visually.

01:57.820 --> 02:01.070
So the header I want to go all the way across.

02:01.210 --> 02:05.910
So I'm going to do header header header.

02:05.920 --> 02:11.530
Now the reason I did it three times is because we're gonna have three boxes that go all the way across.

02:11.530 --> 02:17.470
So you want to have the maximum number of columns you have to have in every row that you do.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.350
So that's our header row.

02:19.370 --> 02:24.010
We don't need a comma the next one is gonna be the content in the sidebar.

02:24.010 --> 02:33.120
So I want the content to take up two of the three and then the sidebar will take up just one here.

02:33.220 --> 02:33.860
OK.

02:34.030 --> 02:37.280
The next one will be the boxes which we have box.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.300
One quotes.

02:40.300 --> 02:46.450
So box one box two in box three and then the footer.

02:46.450 --> 02:48.280
I want to span all the way across.

02:48.310 --> 02:55.000
So we're just going to say footer three times I don't know why I keep forgetting the quotes.

02:55.000 --> 02:55.330
All right.

02:55.330 --> 03:00.970
Now if I save this it's gonna it's gonna turn into a grid but it's not doing what what we want it to

03:00.970 --> 03:06.460
do because we haven't we haven't referenced these as grid areas.

03:06.460 --> 03:12.130
So what we need to do is take each element in and assign it to one of these grid areas so we have a

03:12.130 --> 03:14.460
header with the class of header right.

03:14.470 --> 03:26.590
So I'm gonna say class header and I'm going to assign grid dash area to header OK matching this right

03:26.590 --> 03:27.360
here.

03:27.580 --> 03:34.060
And if I save this notice that now the header goes all the way across and you might not be able to tell

03:34.060 --> 03:39.220
I'm actually going to just paste this in real quick which is just going to add a border around everything

03:39.220 --> 03:42.130
so you can see the actual outline of it.

03:42.970 --> 03:46.300
Let's actually add a grid gap as well.

03:46.300 --> 03:51.490
OK we can you can use all this stuff even though we're using grid template areas it still works like

03:51.490 --> 03:51.940
a grid.

03:51.970 --> 04:01.960
So let's say grid gap one room and save maps what I do here I've got my semicolon.

04:03.100 --> 04:03.930
OK.

04:04.060 --> 04:07.600
So as you can see the header spans across all three.

04:07.780 --> 04:17.290
Now the section the content area I want to be I want to span two and then have the sidebar right here.

04:17.410 --> 04:23.380
So we have that set in the template areas but we haven't assigned the grid areas yet.

04:23.380 --> 04:34.630
So let's take the content and let's assign the grid area to content and then we'll assign the sidebar

04:36.790 --> 04:48.670
class to the grid area of sidebar and if I see that you can see that the content takes up two of them

04:48.960 --> 04:56.590
too and then the the sidebar takes up one and the heading is pretty much in place but we have to add

04:56.590 --> 04:57.850
that as well.

04:57.970 --> 04:59.350
So we're going to take.

04:59.620 --> 05:03.970
I'm sorry not the heading the boxes they say heading inside That's what confused me.

05:04.330 --> 05:05.860
But let's take Box 1

05:08.680 --> 05:19.110
and let's assign a grid area two blocks one which pertains to this right here and then I'm just going

05:19.110 --> 05:24.730
to copy this down because we want to do the same with two and three

05:27.210 --> 05:29.190
OK save that.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.520
No change.

05:31.020 --> 05:36.780
But in the last one here the footer we want to go all the way across which we specified right here that

05:36.780 --> 05:39.230
it's going to but we need to assign the grid area.

05:39.260 --> 05:40.940
So has a class of footer.

05:42.330 --> 05:49.560
And then we can simply say grid area footer and save.

05:49.810 --> 05:50.060
OK.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.400
And that goes all the way across.

05:51.390 --> 05:55.110
So it's actually a line that to the center as well

05:57.740 --> 06:07.070
so text align center and we'll do the same with the header.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.050
Very very ugly.

06:08.060 --> 06:14.040
But I'm just showing you how you can use these great grid template areas to literally map out what your

06:14.120 --> 06:16.480
what your layout look like.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.260
Now let's say you wanted to change this.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.210
Let's say we wanted to do.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.350
Let's actually change.

06:24.740 --> 06:29.270
Let's have box three have its own its own entire row.

06:29.260 --> 06:40.430
So I'm going to say this is gonna be part of Box 2 and then we'll go down and we'll say box 3 box 3

06:40.910 --> 06:42.640
and box 3.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.190
So try to visualize what that's going to look like.

06:45.200 --> 06:54.260
So I'm going to save and what happened is Box 1 takes up one box to takes up to you can see it's longer

06:54.530 --> 06:58.280
and then box three takes up basically it's whole it's whole area here.

06:58.280 --> 07:04.010
Just like the header and the footer does OK so you can kind of experiment with this a little but it's

07:04.010 --> 07:10.580
just so easy to create layouts now OK as opposed to having to float everything and clear them and so

07:10.580 --> 07:12.100
on.

07:12.230 --> 07:17.810
Now in the next video I'm going to show you how to utilize media queries to make your grids responsive.
