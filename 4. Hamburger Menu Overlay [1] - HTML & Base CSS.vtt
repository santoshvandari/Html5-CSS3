WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:01.920
All right guys welcome to your next project.

00:01.920 --> 00:07.710
So I think you're going to enjoy this project because we haven't looked at Hamburger menus or anything

00:07.710 --> 00:08.700
like that yet.

00:08.880 --> 00:14.550
And this is going to be a camp a hamburger menu that's completely and CSX.

00:14.610 --> 00:19.160
Now most of these things have Javascript involved and we're not going to do that.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.600
I'm going to show you a trick so that we don't even have to use javascript.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.120
But first let's take a look at what we'll be building.

00:25.140 --> 00:30.150
Now what you're seeing here this this little splash page with the image this isn't really important

00:30.150 --> 00:32.390
to the project we've done all this before.

00:32.430 --> 00:36.210
We're just going to add an overlay and image and use flex to center it.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.340
What we're focusing on is this right here.

00:38.340 --> 00:43.410
This is a hamburger menu and I believe it gets its name because it has three lines that look like a

00:43.410 --> 00:44.340
hamburger.

00:44.520 --> 00:50.730
And I'm sure you've seen these before where you click them and maybe something opens from the side or

00:50.730 --> 00:54.180
comes down or you get an entire overlay like we're doing.

00:54.180 --> 00:59.700
So I'm just gonna go ahead and click this and notice that a couple of things happen.

00:59.700 --> 01:06.290
So one if we look at the hamburger menu itself it turns into an X which is really cool.

01:06.420 --> 01:13.190
And when we hover off of it and go back on it kind of just goes back and forth which is a neat effect.

01:13.530 --> 01:17.470
And then we get this entire menu overlay with some links here.

01:17.490 --> 01:21.090
So this is a really nice menu because it's completely responsive.

01:21.090 --> 01:23.970
It doesn't matter how big or small the screen size is.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.510
It's going to work and you don't need any extra media queries or anything like we've been doing.

01:29.730 --> 01:35.350
And I built it in a way so that you can use this in other projects pretty easily.

01:35.370 --> 01:41.700
We're actually going to put all this the menu CSX in its own file in a file called menu dot CSX.

01:41.700 --> 01:46.890
Now let me explain how this is actually working without javascript because usually what you would do

01:46.890 --> 01:52.770
is you would dynamically set a class in JavaScript maybe like a show class or something.

01:52.770 --> 01:58.710
So that when you clicked you had a javascript click event that would put in a show class or something

01:58.710 --> 01:59.120
like that.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.410
But we're not doing that.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.990
This is actually a checkbox.

02:03.120 --> 02:11.180
This is an H e-mail input with the type of checkbox and with a checkbox you can style the checked state

02:11.790 --> 02:13.400
when it's exit when it's checked.

02:13.410 --> 02:16.860
You can you can add styles to that and that's what we're doing.

02:16.950 --> 02:23.370
We're basically going to get rid of the checkbox itself and replace it with this but it still has a

02:23.370 --> 02:24.120
check state.

02:24.120 --> 02:28.250
So when I when I click it we're actually checking it and we can create all these styles.

02:28.500 --> 02:35.550
Basically you choose to display this overlay ad transitions transform stuff like that and then we can

02:35.580 --> 02:37.470
uncheck and it goes away.

02:37.470 --> 02:37.830
All right.

02:37.830 --> 02:42.030
So this is something that is very useful very unique.

02:42.060 --> 02:43.610
There's no javascript involved.

02:43.620 --> 02:49.770
So I think you guys will like this little project now we're gonna start with just the Tim Al I want

02:49.770 --> 02:55.410
to create all the each team all which isn't much at all and then just the base style so we get this

02:55.410 --> 02:58.270
image and stuff like that all the stuff we've done already.

02:58.350 --> 03:03.000
And then in the next video we'll start on the actual CSX for the menu.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.330
All right.

03:03.360 --> 03:11.810
So I have an empty folder called hamburger overlay menu and I'm going to just make this smaller we could

03:11.930 --> 03:18.950
probably make this a little smaller because this is completely responsive so it doesn't matter if we

03:18.950 --> 03:24.910
keep it small but we're going to create a file called index each team mouse so let's go up here and

03:24.950 --> 03:34.220
create index start each terminal and then we're going to have a folder called CSX and inside here let's

03:34.220 --> 03:41.090
create a style dot CSX and then like I said I want all the menu stuff to be in its own file so menu

03:41.090 --> 03:49.600
dot CSX and we're gonna have one image so we'll have a folder called I Am G.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.850
And let me just grab that real quick.

03:51.860 --> 03:56.630
Now you guys can get this from the the files in this lecture.

03:56.630 --> 04:00.770
You'll have all the completed files and you can just take it from that.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.100
But let me see.

04:02.120 --> 04:06.440
Just grab it real quick or is it

04:09.600 --> 04:09.860
all right.

04:09.870 --> 04:12.640
So I'm going to just bring this in here.

04:12.650 --> 04:19.130
So there's our image and now let's go into our index each team L and I'm just going to close up this

04:19.220 --> 04:20.050
sidebar.

04:20.660 --> 04:20.970
All right.

04:20.990 --> 04:31.690
So we'll call this hamburger menu overlay and let's link in our style sheets.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.350
So we'll do link.

04:33.350 --> 04:36.080
We're gonna have style dot CSX.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.120
Actually it's an CSF slash style CSX.

04:40.130 --> 04:45.410
And then we also want to include our menu dot CSX.

04:45.440 --> 04:45.780
All right.

04:45.790 --> 04:50.210
And it's up to you if you want to do this stuff if you want include multiple style sheets if you have

04:50.210 --> 04:55.670
a ton of styling for one particular thing like we're doing here then you may want to do it this way

04:56.330 --> 04:58.650
or you could just include it all in one.

04:58.670 --> 05:06.410
So let's start with let's let's take care of the h here Miles so we're gonna have a a div here with

05:06.410 --> 05:12.740
the class of menu wrap and inside here we want our inputs.

05:12.740 --> 05:16.390
And like I said it's going to have a type of checkbox.

05:16.730 --> 05:20.950
And we don't need a name and an I.D. All we need is a class.

05:21.050 --> 05:27.410
And I'm going to call this class toddler OK because that's what it is it's going to toggle that overlay.

05:27.410 --> 05:35.470
And underneath that we're gonna have a div with the class of hamburger and we're gonna have an empty

05:35.470 --> 05:40.030
div in here now the way that we're structuring this might look a little weird but that's what we need

05:40.030 --> 05:44.260
to do in order to get the effect that we're going for.

05:44.380 --> 05:55.650
So we're gonna have a class of menu underneath and then a div and then another div and inside here will

05:55.650 --> 05:56.870
be the UL OK.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.940
So this will be our list.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.550
We'll have list item.

05:59.550 --> 06:01.170
Let's put an A tag.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.110
These aren't going to actually go anywhere.

06:03.270 --> 06:08.550
And I want to give you guys a challenge to turn this into a full Web site.

06:08.550 --> 06:10.380
Look with what you've learned so far.

06:11.070 --> 06:15.240
I'm not going to go through it because I don't want to repeat stuff that we've already done and that

06:15.240 --> 06:21.120
we're gonna do in the future but it be a nice little challenge for you to create an actual site from

06:21.120 --> 06:22.200
this.

06:22.200 --> 06:29.130
I mean obviously you could just point to about Dot HCM L and also include the menu in that page as well.

06:29.130 --> 06:33.880
But we're gonna just copy this down a couple times in this next one.

06:33.900 --> 06:43.500
Actually the top one I'm gonna make home so home about to do services doesn't really matter services

06:43.500 --> 06:46.230
and lots to contact.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.810
OK so that's that.

06:48.810 --> 06:51.300
Let's save this and we'll open it with live server.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.130
And this is going to look very ups.

06:54.150 --> 06:55.140
Hold on what's going on.

06:55.140 --> 07:02.820
I think I have something else open with live server.

07:02.910 --> 07:04.880
You think I still have my news grid open.

07:04.890 --> 07:08.650
Yeah we just closed that up.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.850
OK so let's try that again.

07:11.210 --> 07:12.260
And there it is.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.420
So we just have a little checkbox here.

07:14.420 --> 07:18.530
So we're somehow going to turn this into this with CSX.

07:18.530 --> 07:22.310
That's how powerful it is how powerful CSX is.

07:22.310 --> 07:22.630
OK.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.640
So let's do the rest of the content.

07:24.680 --> 07:36.860
So under the last div we'll create a header with the idea of showcase and let's have a container and

07:36.860 --> 07:45.170
let's also have a showcase dash container we're going to use flex here to Center everything and it's

07:45.170 --> 07:46.070
put an H1.

07:46.070 --> 07:54.140
We'll just say welcome and then a paragraph we'll do like Lorem 20 and then under the paragraph let's

07:54.140 --> 07:57.470
put in a tag with the class of B10.

07:58.160 --> 08:04.310
I realize I didn't have to do this part but I'm doing it for two reasons one just so we have some things

08:04.310 --> 08:10.500
to so it looks decent and so that we can reiterate things that we've you've already learned.

08:10.550 --> 08:10.900
All right.

08:10.910 --> 08:16.800
So now let's go into our style that CSX and let's add our our main styles.

08:16.940 --> 08:23.810
Now we're gonna use variables here so let's say in our route scope we're gonna have a primary color

08:26.930 --> 08:35.480
and I'm going to use our GPA K member RG B is red green blue alpha so we can add transparency to to

08:35.480 --> 08:37.640
the element using the color.

08:37.650 --> 08:47.560
Okay so we're gonna have 13 1 10 one thirty nine and then the opacity or the Alpha will be point seventy

08:47.570 --> 08:48.670
five.

08:48.790 --> 08:53.180
Okay so it's gonna be this color here and it's gonna be a little see through and we're also going to

08:53.180 --> 08:57.050
have a secondary color which is gonna be like an orange.

08:57.110 --> 09:08.480
So it's a secondary color we're going to use that for the hover links and that's gonna be 2 2 9 1 4

09:08.510 --> 09:15.500
8 0 and let's do an alpha of just zero point nine

09:19.600 --> 09:20.210
OK.

09:20.280 --> 09:25.140
And then we're gonna have an overlay color so the overlay is gonna be.

09:25.590 --> 09:26.120
Actually no.

09:26.150 --> 09:32.090
I should probably keep the keep the file open just so I can show you like what's what.

09:32.510 --> 09:38.760
So this right here the background is gonna be the overlay color the.

09:39.350 --> 09:39.590
Yeah.

09:39.590 --> 09:50.520
That's gonna be the overlay so let's change this to overlay and this is gonna be 24 is going to be pretty

09:50.520 --> 09:53.340
similar to the primary but darker.

09:53.340 --> 10:05.110
So twenty four thirty nine fifty one and we're gonna do zero point eight five.

10:05.130 --> 10:05.550
OK.

10:05.550 --> 10:12.030
Now if you want this to be less transparent see how we can see the welcome behind it.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.930
You can just raise this up.

10:14.010 --> 10:20.260
You'll be able to just put this to maybe ninety five or just one if you want it to be solid but I like

10:20.310 --> 10:22.640
I like to look the see through effect.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.000
All right.

10:23.010 --> 10:29.040
So that's our overlay color and then last thing I want is the is the speed OK how fast this actually

10:29.040 --> 10:32.520
opens I want to put that in a variable so that it's easy to access.

10:32.520 --> 10:38.880
So let's say menu dash speed zero point seventy five seconds.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.060
And I know that this has to do with the menu and this is styled out CSX but I didn't want to put separate

10:45.060 --> 10:47.180
variables in the menu CSF.

10:47.190 --> 10:54.000
We can actually use these variables in that file because we're putting we're including the style CSX

10:54.000 --> 10:58.320
before the menu so we're able to use those variables.

10:58.320 --> 10:58.680
OK.

10:58.680 --> 11:05.650
Now let's add our reset so say margin zero.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.440
And we'd like to put a space there.

11:08.970 --> 11:20.940
Margin zero and having zero and then let's do box sizing for the box for the body we're going to use

11:20.940 --> 11:22.280
the rubato font.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.810
So we have to grab that real quick.

11:24.840 --> 11:32.910
Let's go to Google fonts and rubato I have right here I'm just going to click that and I'm going to

11:32.910 --> 11:36.180
grab to make this a little bigger

11:41.360 --> 11:41.620
OK.

11:41.690 --> 11:46.030
So I'm going to grab this link and put that in the index each time.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.920
All right above the style sheets

11:53.660 --> 11:55.410
all right so let's see.

11:55.410 --> 12:05.670
Next thing in our style CSX we want to add the font family which is going to be rubato

12:08.070 --> 12:10.260
sans serif.

12:10.260 --> 12:20.420
And then let's do a line height of one point four OK and then we have our container to move everything

12:20.420 --> 12:21.730
to the middle.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.840
So we're going to set a max width and I'm going to do nine sixty.

12:25.860 --> 12:29.780
And the reason I'm doing it so thin is because I don't want it to get in the way of the menu.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.610
I want the menu to always be outside of it.

12:32.630 --> 12:37.790
So even if we go like here you can see that there is there is room here.

12:37.790 --> 12:42.320
So when we scroll down the content will be this won't cover the content.

12:42.350 --> 12:46.140
Basically you can experiment with it if you want.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.790
And that goes for any project if you guys want to experiment with different values and do things a little

12:50.790 --> 12:52.950
differently that's that's absolutely fine.

12:52.950 --> 12:55.100
In fact I encourage that.

12:55.170 --> 13:00.640
So let's say margin auto we want to push it to the middle.

13:00.690 --> 13:03.380
Overflow should be hidden.

13:04.050 --> 13:10.620
And let's add the padding that's another thing that's going to push the content in so let's do zero

13:10.620 --> 13:13.760
top and bottom and three ram left and right.

13:14.730 --> 13:15.080
OK.

13:15.090 --> 13:20.130
So if we if we save this it's going to look like this for now.

13:20.190 --> 13:23.040
Now let's see what should we do next.

13:23.040 --> 13:28.690
Let's do the showcase so showcase.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.740
And I'm going to do the background of the showcase as the primary colors.

13:34.770 --> 13:44.790
So we'll put in our very variable of primary color and let's do color whites and we'll set the height

13:44.820 --> 13:52.140
to 100 viewport height so want to take up the whole page and position relative I'm doing position relative

13:52.170 --> 14:00.750
because we're gonna use the before pseudo selector to add our overlay and the overlay has to be position

14:00.750 --> 14:07.260
absolute and remember that position absolute is relative to its first relative container which of course

14:07.260 --> 14:08.900
we want to be the showcase.

14:09.030 --> 14:14.880
If not it will use the body as the as its container.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.140
So that's good that's save.

14:17.550 --> 14:23.670
And just you can pretty much completely ignore this whole part because we're going to be changing this.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.560
It's not going to display it for us.

14:25.890 --> 14:30.620
We're going to add some see ISIS to hide it and then it's only going to show when we click that the

14:30.810 --> 14:34.470
the hamburger which right now is a checkbox.

14:34.470 --> 14:40.220
So let's go down here and say showcase before.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.950
And remember if we use before or after we need a content value but we're not actually inserting content.

14:46.140 --> 14:52.120
So we just put nothing and then the background U.R.L..

14:52.620 --> 14:58.830
So the URL is going to be dot dot slash AMG slash showcase.

14:58.830 --> 15:07.500
We want to do no repeat center center slash cover as usual.

15:07.500 --> 15:12.450
And then again like I said before we want to position this absolute.

15:12.450 --> 15:22.170
We want it to start at the top zero and left zero corner in span all the way across and all the way

15:22.170 --> 15:26.230
up and down.

15:26.470 --> 15:29.100
So if we save that we get our image.

15:29.110 --> 15:38.530
Now the image is covering everything so let's set the z index to negative 1 and save and there we go.

15:38.530 --> 15:42.850
So now the image is behind the coloring.

15:42.850 --> 15:43.310
All right.

15:43.310 --> 15:49.060
And the read this is a little different than how we've done it before because we're using an RGA value

15:49.060 --> 15:58.800
and that is what this primary color right here if I change this to one and save it's going to be solid.

15:58.810 --> 16:03.580
So the transparency for the background images is controlled with this.

16:03.670 --> 16:07.120
If I do like four or five you'll see that it's lighter.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.770
So you can change it to how you want.

16:09.880 --> 16:10.290
OK.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.740
And then the overlay is going to be the menu overlay transparency.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.030
So there's really two levels of transparency.

16:17.590 --> 16:19.190
So let's see.

16:19.210 --> 16:25.120
Let's let's make the showcase container a flex box so that we can center everything.

16:25.180 --> 16:38.980
So we'll see a showcase showcase container on a display flex and set the Flex direction to column because

16:38.980 --> 16:42.870
we want this to go up and down and we want to do all of our centering.

16:42.880 --> 16:55.690
So a line items center that should start to get drilled in your head justify the content center and

16:55.690 --> 16:59.180
text align center.

16:59.950 --> 17:01.870
So that should put it in the middle.

17:01.870 --> 17:06.450
Now it's not down here because I haven't added the height.

17:06.460 --> 17:14.440
We have the height for for the actual showcase which is 100 viewport but the showcase container we need

17:14.440 --> 17:17.490
to set that to 100 percent of its parent.

17:17.550 --> 17:17.820
OK.

17:17.860 --> 17:23.280
So we'll set height to 100 percent and save.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.410
And now that will get pushed down.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.550
All right so let's see the H1.

17:29.770 --> 17:35.740
I want to make that bigger so showcase each one.

17:35.830 --> 17:41.960
Let's set the font size to do for them.

17:42.100 --> 17:46.230
I think I did three on the other one but I think I think it should be a little bigger.

17:46.340 --> 17:49.880
I make the take the paragraph a little bigger as well.

17:50.590 --> 17:58.610
Showcase paragraph font size will do one point three REM all right.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.250
And then for the button that that'll be the last thing.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.290
Let's just do a class of B10

18:06.290 --> 18:07.310
so the button.

18:07.310 --> 18:16.080
I'm going to do our same rigamarole we've been doing we want to display as inline block.

18:17.060 --> 18:21.690
And let's set the border to none in the background.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.720
I'm actually going to use the primary color

18:28.090 --> 18:31.530
and it's two color whites.

18:31.660 --> 18:33.590
Let's do padding.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.160
So for the padding we'll do.

18:35.170 --> 18:36.790
Point seven five REM.

18:36.790 --> 18:40.940
Top and bottom one point five REM left and right.

18:41.170 --> 18:47.650
And I just want to add a little margin top of one RAM just to bring it down a little bit and let's add

18:47.650 --> 18:54.070
a transition so that when we hover over it it will kind of smoothly transition into the hover effect.

18:54.100 --> 19:02.950
So going to say all one second and we'll say he's easing out so save.

19:02.950 --> 19:07.440
There he go and all the the underline.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.660
Let's get rid of that text decoration.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.890
None.

19:15.990 --> 19:16.480
All right.

19:16.480 --> 19:25.420
So now we're gonna do the hover state so button hover and since we're using a variable where it could

19:25.420 --> 19:26.610
be any color.

19:26.650 --> 19:31.330
I'm just going to use opacity as the effect and we'll do zero point seven.

19:31.390 --> 19:32.260
So I'll save.

19:32.260 --> 19:37.720
And then when I hover over it you'll see that it changes and it does it nice and smooth because we added

19:37.720 --> 19:42.100
the transition we could just do transition opacity.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.050
We don't need to do all.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.570
And there we go.

19:46.570 --> 19:46.930
All right.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.800
So that's gonna be it for the this this whole showcase area.

19:50.800 --> 19:58.030
Everything we do from now on is going to be for the menu and there's a lot of CSX now having something

19:58.030 --> 19:59.830
like this is really cool.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.130
It looks really cool but it is a lot of work.

20:02.140 --> 20:05.630
There's a lot of CSX that goes into doing something like this.

20:05.650 --> 20:05.980
All right.

20:05.980 --> 20:11.410
So we're gonna jump into that and that's the reason I haven't created the hamburger menu on every project

20:11.440 --> 20:14.560
we've done because it would just take up so much time.

20:14.650 --> 20:16.610
But I did want to include it in the course.

20:16.630 --> 20:18.400
So I'll see you in the next video.
