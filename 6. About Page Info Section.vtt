WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:06.900
All right guys so we finished the index page here in terms of the desktop view we will do some stuff

00:07.860 --> 00:09.780
for a responsive design later.

00:09.780 --> 00:11.460
Now we're gonna move to the about page.

00:11.460 --> 00:18.510
So in this code we're going to let's actually create a new file in the disk folder.

00:18.510 --> 00:24.790
We want to make sure you're in the dist folder and we're gonna call this about Dot H HD CML.

00:24.930 --> 00:30.600
Now what I'm going to do is copy everything from the index and then get rid of most of it because there

00:30.600 --> 00:34.530
is some stuff here we need such as that all the head had data.

00:34.530 --> 00:41.710
I'm sorry had had mark up here as well as the footer and also some of the stuff from the header.

00:42.090 --> 00:42.420
OK.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.730
So as far as this goes is this this can all be the same.

00:46.800 --> 00:59.310
Actually we can change the go ahead and change the title here to about me and then let's delete everything

00:59.310 --> 01:04.520
from Section A Down to the top down to Section C..

01:04.530 --> 01:06.480
So we want to leave the footer there.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.040
We also want to leave the reference.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.150
Actually I'm sorry we want to delete the reference to the typewriter script because we no longer need

01:12.150 --> 01:12.390
that.

01:12.390 --> 01:14.550
That's only on the home page.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.030
OK.

01:15.030 --> 01:24.390
And let's see in the header we're going to actually cut this down quite a bit.

01:24.390 --> 01:31.560
So we want to change the I.D. now to head our inner we want to keep the container we want to keep the

01:31.560 --> 01:37.590
NAV this should all be the same except we want to move the current class from home now that are on the

01:37.590 --> 01:44.580
about page we want to move that to about K and then we can get rid of the the whole header content did

01:44.600 --> 01:49.470
for right here you don't need that and that should be good.

01:49.470 --> 01:57.480
Now if we save this and we go back and we go to about I'm sorry that's that's the finished product.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.580
Let's go to about and now it looks like this.

01:59.580 --> 02:06.660
So let's deal with the header inner obviously the image is not showing here so we're gonna jump into

02:08.940 --> 02:14.260
main dot SPSS and go up to where we have our header stuff.

02:14.580 --> 02:21.360
So where it says header enter here where I'm actually gonna copy the the background image grab this

02:21.360 --> 02:25.730
background in height and in the header dash inner.

02:25.730 --> 02:31.080
We're gonna have the same background image except I just want to change the position a little bit instead

02:31.080 --> 02:31.860
of centre right.

02:31.860 --> 02:40.080
I'm gonna do 20 percent on the x axis and then let's do 30 percent on the y just to kind of move it

02:40.080 --> 02:45.060
a little bit just so the head of the guy isn't covering the logo or anything.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.160
And then the height.

02:46.170 --> 02:53.460
I'm just going to set to 5.5 RAM and then I also want to have a border a border on the bottom to kind

02:53.460 --> 02:58.410
of separate it from the rest of the content which will be three pixels solid and I want to make it the

02:58.410 --> 02:59.290
main color.

03:00.390 --> 03:04.780
OK so if we save that and we go back it's gonna look like this.

03:04.800 --> 03:10.100
OK so let's see now we want to deal with the rest of the.

03:10.110 --> 03:14.090
About content and we're going to start with this area.

03:14.120 --> 03:20.610
So this is gonna be about a It's gonna be a section and I want to use grid template areas.

03:20.610 --> 03:27.910
So we'll have like the bio I'm sorry the bio image the bio and then award one two and three.

03:27.930 --> 03:36.690
OK so let's go to about each GMO we'll go directly under the the header here and let's just say section

03:36.780 --> 03:37.290
a

03:40.080 --> 03:49.230
I guess it's the info so we're gonna create a section and let's given an I.D. of about sensor on the

03:49.230 --> 03:53.370
about page and then a and a class of text.

03:53.370 --> 03:59.960
Class of text stash center and let's do P Y three for some padding OK.

03:59.970 --> 04:08.110
We also want a container to move everything to the middle we want a title so section dash title we're

04:08.110 --> 04:14.760
gonna say about me and let's do bottom line div

04:17.510 --> 04:24.640
K and then we're gonna do a paragraph with the class of lead and we're just going to say let me tell

04:24.640 --> 04:26.020
you a little

04:28.470 --> 04:36.760
about my self and what I do and then we're gonna have a class of let's do info

04:39.560 --> 04:47.120
and this is where this this info here let's call it about info this is gonna be the grid and then the

04:47.120 --> 04:51.430
items will be the template areas that will assign within the CSX.

04:51.440 --> 05:02.800
So let's first have our image I'm going to give it a class of bio dash image and let's give it a source

05:02.860 --> 05:13.750
of I am G I want to go I m g slash and C about Dot J peg right and then underneath that we're gonna

05:13.750 --> 05:20.710
have a div with the class of bio and I want to give this a light background and so I don't we didn't

05:20.710 --> 05:24.070
create the background classes yet but we will do that.

05:24.070 --> 05:31.360
So I'm going to do big dash light because I wanted to have a light gray background and then let's do

05:31.360 --> 05:43.600
an H for let's say we'll just see your project is in safe hands and if you don't like this tax you can

05:43.600 --> 05:48.700
change it and then I'm just gonna do like let's say Lorem 30

05:51.270 --> 05:57.430
so underneath this div of bio and BJP light we're gonna have our awards.

05:57.430 --> 06:05.520
So let's do a class of award dash one and we're gonna use the award icons.

06:05.520 --> 06:12.060
We want to do AI with the class of F.A. s and then F A Dash award.

06:12.060 --> 06:19.500
And then for the size we're gonna do F A Dash three X and then let's put an H three and we'll just say

06:19.550 --> 06:31.780
award ward one and then some text will do us we'll do Y is not.

06:31.870 --> 06:39.850
Large ten and I'm just gonna copy the award div so we'll do two three of them and we're just going to

06:39.850 --> 06:42.580
change the class here to to this one two three.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.470
We'll keep the same icon.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.210
Let's just change up this text.

06:46.210 --> 06:51.960
This will be award two will be award three okay.

06:52.060 --> 06:55.060
So that should be it for this section so we'll save it.

06:55.060 --> 06:59.170
And if we go back this is what it's going to look like without styling.

06:59.680 --> 07:05.260
So let's head into it let's let's do our utility first.

07:05.260 --> 07:12.780
Our background colors because I want to be able to assign you know b g dark BJP light.

07:12.790 --> 07:14.420
What else BJP main.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.040
So we'll add those classes.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.980
Let's put it.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.670
Let's go under the buttons so go right here.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.890
Backgrounds.

07:31.580 --> 07:36.470
So let's let's take class BJP.

07:36.590 --> 07:44.150
And then we're going to add in here and Sam Dash main which will be BJP dash main and then I'm going

07:44.150 --> 07:53.130
to set a background of main dash colour and then for the colour.

07:53.150 --> 07:58.360
This is where we definitely want to use set text color which is the function that we created.

07:59.900 --> 08:04.120
And we want to pass in the same as the background.

08:04.160 --> 08:04.460
All right.

08:04.460 --> 08:13.610
And then I'm just going to grab this and let's have for these except this is where we're gonna change

08:13.610 --> 08:14.270
to dark.

08:14.270 --> 08:16.140
I'm going to do control D.

08:16.160 --> 08:20.110
One two one time two times and then just do dark.

08:20.260 --> 08:20.630
Okay.

08:20.630 --> 08:28.130
Same thing here we'll do light and let's also do medium.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.730
OK so that way we can have all the different colors as backgrounds if we want.

08:32.730 --> 08:35.570
In the text will adapt to what it should be.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.250
So it can contrast.

08:38.330 --> 08:38.630
All right.

08:38.630 --> 08:43.420
So now we have that down.

08:43.670 --> 08:51.590
So we want to start to deal with aligning all the stuff that's in this about info class.

08:51.590 --> 08:54.430
So we're going to do this.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.200
Let's see in our main dot SPSS.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.210
Let's go back below the home

09:04.080 --> 09:07.540
this is lot of stuff in the home so that ends here.

09:08.260 --> 09:20.950
So let's do about sections so we have about and then we want to style the A section so we'll do an %

09:20.980 --> 09:23.250
dash a.

09:23.650 --> 09:29.180
And we have our about Dash info.

09:29.590 --> 09:38.590
We want to display that as grid K so grid items except we're gonna use grid template areas which we

09:38.590 --> 09:45.610
haven't I don't think we've used in a project yet and in grid template areas is basically just a visualization

09:45.610 --> 09:46.750
of how you want it set.

09:46.760 --> 09:57.250
So we're gonna have the bio image and then the bio so bio is gonna extend further than the image as

09:57.250 --> 10:01.240
you can see right here so bio and then Bio Bio.

10:01.270 --> 10:02.720
So this is longer.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.180
Okay.

10:03.190 --> 10:06.100
And then down below we want the three awards.

10:06.550 --> 10:18.210
So let's go onto the next line here and let's do we'll just say a W one a W2 and a W three.

10:18.210 --> 10:22.870
So that's this is you know visually how we want it set up.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.860
So we have to assign the grid areas.

10:26.860 --> 10:34.060
Actually let me just add a grid gap first with a semicolon there and let's say grid gap and we'll do

10:34.060 --> 10:35.700
one point two Ram.

10:37.330 --> 10:37.720
OK.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.660
Now under the about info let's set up our grid areas.

10:43.120 --> 10:48.780
So we have a class of bio image they call it image here.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.980
I am G.

10:50.980 --> 10:51.660
So right here.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.450
But let's do.

10:52.470 --> 10:52.580
Yeah.

10:52.630 --> 11:05.440
I hope we'll keep up image I guess so bio image we want to set that grid area to the bio image grid

11:05.440 --> 11:13.180
area which is this right here we want to put this inside that our assign that to that and then let's

11:13.180 --> 11:15.560
also grab the bio.

11:15.560 --> 11:15.830
OK.

11:15.850 --> 11:25.620
So Class of bio we're going to sign that grid area to bio and then I'm also gonna add just a border

11:25.630 --> 11:29.470
left just to give it a little bit of a little bit of style.

11:30.010 --> 11:37.570
So we'll do three pixels solid and let's make it the main color.

11:38.360 --> 11:38.850
OK.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.480
And then we'll just do some padding.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.520
Let's do zero point eight Ram.

11:43.610 --> 11:44.010
OK.

11:44.040 --> 11:44.860
So that's that.

11:44.860 --> 11:52.120
Now we want to do the three awards so remember we have the class of award dash one which will set to

11:52.120 --> 12:06.010
the grid area of a W one above and then I'll just copy this and let's do award two and let's do award

12:06.160 --> 12:08.510
three.

12:08.560 --> 12:08.980
OK.

12:09.010 --> 12:12.160
Now the icon for the award.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.560
I just want to make it the the main color.

12:15.680 --> 12:25.980
So I'm going to go down here and just grab all of them so we'll say award one too.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.880
I'm sorry I want to grab the icon.

12:27.880 --> 12:32.180
So I want the class of F.A. s in each one.

12:32.650 --> 12:40.530
Yes and award dash three f.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.990
Yes.

12:44.220 --> 12:44.790
OK.

12:44.790 --> 12:52.860
And then let's make the colour the main colour and I'm just going to add a little bit of margin one

12:52.860 --> 12:56.870
room give it some space.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.750
So let's go back and there we go.

13:00.280 --> 13:00.500
OK.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.820
So we set the bio to this grid area.

13:02.930 --> 13:10.670
I'm sorry the bio image than the bio to stretch across basically two columns and then the award each

13:10.670 --> 13:12.640
award goes in each column.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.470
OK.

13:15.590 --> 13:20.630
So I think we'll go ahead and stop here and in the next video we'll continue on with the progress bars

13:20.630 --> 13:22.130
and the rest of the about page.
