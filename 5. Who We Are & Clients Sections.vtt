WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:00.560
All right.

00:00.570 --> 00:06.420
So now we're going to start on the WHO WE ARE section so right underneath the what we do section.

00:06.480 --> 00:17.040
We're gonna put a comment and let's say section who we are and we're going to use a section tag with

00:17.040 --> 00:25.710
an I.D. of who and you guys can see the the the pattern in how I do things so basically we have a header

00:25.710 --> 00:32.040
at the top or head or NAV combination whatever and then everything under that is usually a section and

00:32.040 --> 00:36.660
that's how I build pretty much all my web sites in you eyes.

00:36.660 --> 00:45.570
So inside this section basically we're gonna have a flex box with two items which is gonna be one the

00:45.570 --> 00:48.980
background image one is gonna be this side here.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.660
And I want it to go all the way to the edge.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.770
So this goes all the way over this goes all the way over so we're not we're actually not going to use

00:55.770 --> 00:59.280
a container in this section.

00:59.280 --> 01:07.640
So the section itself is gonna be the Flex box and then the two items let's do one we'll call it who

01:07.660 --> 01:09.580
Dash I am G.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.010
It's just going to be a background image.

01:11.020 --> 01:19.810
So no no content inside the div and then let's call this one who dash text history of the image in the

01:19.810 --> 01:23.690
way of the text and these are gonna be flexed flex items.

01:23.770 --> 01:33.130
Now the WHO text we're going to also add a couple utility classes I want to add big dark tree stuff

01:33.130 --> 01:39.910
to create and I'm going to do p. 2 I'm going to add some padding classes that have padding all the way

01:39.910 --> 01:47.470
around that's why I don't have P Y P Y is for the up and down access P2 or P anything is going to be

01:47.470 --> 01:51.240
padding all around as you can see that we have here.

01:51.700 --> 02:01.680
So inside here it's put a H two and this H2 is gonna be an M heading so you can see that we we almost

02:01.680 --> 02:06.560
create our own framework when we do this if you have any experience with bootstrap or any kind of each

02:06.560 --> 02:12.360
team LCROSS framework you have built in classes that do certain things and that's pretty much what we're

02:12.360 --> 02:18.300
doing is we're creating our own built in classes so that we can use them over and over instead of styling

02:18.330 --> 02:25.200
you know the the WHO's section H to the what section H H2 and stuff like that we just have these base

02:25.200 --> 02:29.430
utilities that we can use and I think that's the best way to do things.

02:29.490 --> 02:32.550
So who is going to be inside the tech's primary

02:36.630 --> 02:42.630
and if you don't know for instance bootstrap or front end framework like that then you'll see once you

02:42.630 --> 02:49.440
start to learn bootstrap that a lot of these classes I actually take from from bootstrap like text primary

02:50.340 --> 02:59.590
so let's do who and then outside of the span will do we are and then after the H two let's do a paragraph

02:59.610 --> 03:07.600
and I think I did 30 here let's do Lorem 30 and then let's see underneath the paragraph we're gonna

03:07.620 --> 03:17.670
have another h three or h three and we're gonna say our team and then a U L and I'm going to give this

03:17.670 --> 03:26.520
you all a class of list because we need to style it it has some bottom borders take away the the bullet

03:26.520 --> 03:27.900
points stuff like that.

03:28.080 --> 03:35.820
So let's do an ally we have how many looks like what we have five here so times five and we'll just

03:35.820 --> 03:41.970
put some names in here like Mark Smith will say that Mark is the CEO

03:44.250 --> 03:50.580
and let's to Shannon Johnson the CFO

03:53.840 --> 04:01.580
and see John Corbett I don't know where I get these names from a lead accountant

04:07.410 --> 04:13.280
and let's see we have Janet Williams

04:15.380 --> 04:29.540
investment manager and then finally we have Kara Jackson senior accountant and I tried to keep the names

04:30.200 --> 04:35.600
you know with this this image right here actually I'm missing one I the six people here that that's

04:35.600 --> 04:38.720
fine whatever you want to add another one you can.

04:38.870 --> 04:39.170
All right.

04:39.190 --> 04:45.860
So that's pretty much it for the section let's save it let's go back to ours and there we go so it looks

04:45.860 --> 04:48.970
like crap obviously but we're gonna fix that.

04:49.100 --> 04:56.820
So in our style CSX just gonna go ahead and make this a little smaller let's make sure that.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.030
OK so that's still all right.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.460
So let's go under the what section

05:07.500 --> 05:14.630
it's good to keep your your CSX and your age team all commented out just just so you can see you know

05:15.590 --> 05:20.060
what goes where I think it better organizes your your code.

05:20.060 --> 05:27.900
So like I said Who itself the idea of who is going to be the Flex container so let's say I.D. who and

05:27.950 --> 05:38.610
let's say we want to display flex flex and I want just equal sides.

05:38.620 --> 05:47.930
So what I'm going to do is say any div that's inside the WHO div I'm going to say flex 1.

05:48.060 --> 05:48.730
OK.

05:48.730 --> 05:50.380
The divs are the Flex items right.

05:50.380 --> 05:54.550
We have the section which is the Flex box or the Flex container.

05:54.550 --> 06:02.990
And then each of these is the is the is the div or the item and I'm setting it to flex one.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.740
So now it's just split half and half.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.170
Now on this side I want the background image.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.120
So let's do that.

06:09.130 --> 06:19.520
Let's say the idea of who in the class of who dash image I'm going to set the background to a U.R.L.

06:20.850 --> 06:27.970
and the image is gonna we want to go outside of CSX inside of image and we want the people dot J Peg

06:28.520 --> 06:31.160
okay and we're going to add our no repeat.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.330
We're going to center and cover

06:38.230 --> 06:42.010
so now we have our image and then see

06:46.960 --> 06:51.280
over here we shouldn't really have to do anything else we just make this a little bigger.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.710
We shouldn't have to do anything except our utility classes because that'll cover the padding as well

06:56.710 --> 06:57.940
as the background color.

06:57.940 --> 07:04.690
So remember we have a big dark let's go up here where we have the beachy light.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.580
I think we have a big light.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.260
Oh we didn't even add that huh.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.430
No we didn't.

07:09.430 --> 07:09.780
All right.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.550
So let's put that under the text here.

07:12.620 --> 07:27.480
Let's say BFG light which has a background of light gray and color 3 3 3 and then let's also

07:30.370 --> 07:35.380
copy this down and this is gonna be beachy dark

07:38.110 --> 07:39.210
and then beachy dark.

07:39.220 --> 07:41.320
We're just going to kind of reverse this.

07:41.470 --> 07:50.260
So we're going to do 3 3 3 and then for the color let's switch we'll do white for the color colors and

07:50.260 --> 07:51.670
save.

07:51.670 --> 07:59.830
So now this has the light gray this as the dark we need to add some padding here or not add the padding

07:59.860 --> 08:05.160
but add the class of I think we use P to you know use P too.

08:05.360 --> 08:10.030
So let's go right under where we did all these paintings

08:12.990 --> 08:14.730
copy it and I'll do just

08:18.610 --> 08:19.880
do we do a dash.

08:19.930 --> 08:29.350
Yeah P dash 2 so we have one two and three and I'm going to use the same amounts.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.510
So one point five two and three except we want it to be on all sides.

08:33.510 --> 08:38.850
We just want to get rid of the zero because um we just have this one value which will be for all sides

08:38.850 --> 08:40.230
so let's save that.

08:40.230 --> 08:41.770
And now check it out.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.890
We have our padding.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.600
We have our background color.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.910
Well we didn't do is the list.

08:47.910 --> 08:55.200
Now the list is I'm going to make this a utility because we might want to use this less styling somewhere

08:55.200 --> 09:03.900
else so I don't want to I don't want to you know keep it inside the The Who div or the WHO I.D..

09:04.200 --> 09:07.410
So the list I'm going to put under the button here

09:10.320 --> 09:20.440
and let's first of all give it some margin on the top and bottom will do zero point five rim zero.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.740
OK so now it's at least you have some space there.

09:24.040 --> 09:29.990
And then I'm gonna take away the bullet points so list style none.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.710
And for the list items

09:36.780 --> 09:43.080
I'm going to add some padding to the top and bottom zero point five Ram.

09:43.470 --> 09:50.290
And then let's add a border bottom and let's do four for four.

09:50.760 --> 09:55.970
Let's two dotted has a style and one pixel and save.

09:56.720 --> 09:56.990
OK.

09:57.000 --> 09:57.990
So it's pretty good.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.780
All right cool.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.780
So let's see.

10:05.790 --> 10:10.530
I think the clients section is easy enough for us to go ahead and do in this video.

10:10.530 --> 10:25.110
So underneath who we are let's put section clients and we'll do a section with an idea of clients and

10:25.110 --> 10:31.070
I want to add a class of p y one so padding.

10:31.070 --> 10:38.550
It'll be one point five ram on the top and bottom and then we want a container because we want or we

10:38.550 --> 10:42.810
want to move everything to the metal and we want an h to.

10:42.840 --> 10:52.440
I'm going to give this a class of M heading as well as text center and we're gonna say our clients but

10:52.440 --> 10:54.330
the word our will be green.

10:54.330 --> 11:01.240
So we want to do a span here of text primary we'll say our.

11:01.290 --> 11:05.600
And then outside of the span we'll say clients.

11:05.890 --> 11:14.530
Now we're going to use flex again here to align the images so we're going to do a class of items or

11:15.860 --> 11:16.590
let's see.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.550
Let's do um

11:22.950 --> 11:23.380
you know what.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.020
I think you if we look in our style CSX I mean just.

11:28.050 --> 11:28.330
OK.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.690
So we did target what items.

11:30.690 --> 11:39.030
So it's we can use the class items here as well and inside items we're just going to have basically

11:39.260 --> 11:45.510
a div with the image K so the div is going to be the actual flex item.

11:45.510 --> 11:48.300
And then each div will have an image.

11:48.300 --> 11:56.280
And this is gonna be dot slash since we're in the index each time l We want to be in the same folder

11:56.280 --> 12:01.710
and then we want to go into the image folder and then we want to go into logos and I'm gonna do logo

12:01.710 --> 12:08.130
one PMG and we make this a little bigger and then for the all.

12:08.170 --> 12:11.120
I'm just going to say also a client.

12:11.390 --> 12:11.790
OK.

12:11.980 --> 12:18.700
Obviously we don't put anything in here it's just the image but let's copy this down five times and

12:18.700 --> 12:20.380
then we're just going to change the image.

12:20.380 --> 12:25.410
Those will be local five four three and two.

12:26.080 --> 12:34.220
And I'm also just going to add a P1 class here or p y one to add some padding here.

12:34.240 --> 12:34.560
All right.

12:34.570 --> 12:37.340
So let's save that and take a look.

12:37.380 --> 12:37.710
OK.

12:37.720 --> 12:43.480
So obviously it's just going to show it's just each image on a separate line because they're they're

12:43.480 --> 12:48.660
in a div so divs are block level and we haven't we haven't made this a flex box yet.

12:48.670 --> 12:52.180
So we want to do that so that we can align them.

12:52.440 --> 13:05.170
So all right here let's say clients and let's take the client's I.D. and the items class and let's display

13:06.070 --> 13:08.690
that as flex.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.400
Once I do that you'll see that it's going to align them this way.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.140
Now the images are way too big.

13:14.140 --> 13:16.030
They're going off the screen here.

13:16.030 --> 13:22.840
So I'm going to target clients items and then the images themselves.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.450
And for one I'm going to display a block.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.230
OK I want to be able to add a width to them.

13:29.230 --> 13:35.770
I'm gonna say margin auto so that they're right in the center and then I'm going to set the width of

13:35.770 --> 13:40.090
the image to 60 percent of its container and we'll save that.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.920
And there we go.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.220
OK.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.980
So that's that's it for the client section.

13:44.980 --> 13:51.610
So in the next video we're going to start to work on the contact and in the contact we have a little

13:51.610 --> 13:58.600
form here we also have a map case or where we're gonna have to do to implement a map is get an API key

13:58.600 --> 14:05.620
from Google Maps so you will have to log into your Google account and we're gonna use the console to

14:05.620 --> 14:07.180
generate an API key.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.310
OK.

14:08.350 --> 14:10.470
And if and if you don't know what that is.

14:10.570 --> 14:12.280
You know I've never heard of an API key.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.190
Don't worry about it.

14:13.230 --> 14:16.590
We're going to go step by step and we're gonna go through it.

14:16.750 --> 14:16.990
All right.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.310
So I'll see you in the next video.
