WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:00.440
All right.

00:00.450 --> 00:04.930
So in the last video we set up our file structure for our little Web site here.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.800
And we created the nav bar and also styled it.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.900
So we have this now bar at the top.

00:09.900 --> 00:14.850
The next thing you want to do is the showcase area which is this right here this background image.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.710
This tax this button here.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.120
So that's what we're going to move on to.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.660
So within the header case we have our header tag.

00:21.660 --> 00:26.220
We have the NAV and then under the NAV is where we want to put our showcase.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.780
So I'm just going to use a div here and I'm going to give it an idea of showcase.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.400
And inside here we're gonna want another container.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.740
So let me explain why we need this.

00:37.770 --> 00:45.060
If I stretch to so if we don't put a container our content is going to go all the way over here just

00:45.060 --> 00:50.910
like you saw at the now bar in the last video so we don't want the container around the showcase because

00:50.910 --> 00:53.390
then that the image would be constricted.

00:53.390 --> 00:53.730
All right.

00:53.760 --> 00:59.820
So we want the showcase to go all the way out but we want the content inside to be within a container.

00:59.820 --> 01:09.900
So let's go ahead and add a class of container here and then all of this stuff the heading button paragraph.

01:09.930 --> 01:18.560
I'm going to put that inside of a class called let's call it showcase dash content.

01:18.590 --> 01:19.200
That's what it is.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.970
It's the content within the showcase.

01:21.720 --> 01:29.250
So inside here we have an H1 that says enjoy your stay.

01:29.250 --> 01:33.960
And then underneath that we have a paragraph which I think it's 15.

01:33.960 --> 01:40.080
I'm just going to do Lorem 15 enter and then underneath that we have a link.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.900
And this is actually going to go to the about page.

01:42.900 --> 01:50.370
So about Dot H Timo and for the text will say about our hotel.

01:50.930 --> 01:51.290
OK.

01:51.320 --> 01:58.320
So if we take a look should look like this now there's a couple of things that I left out here that

01:58.320 --> 02:03.310
we need to add one if you notice the enjoys it is a different color.

02:03.360 --> 02:08.130
So the way it is now there is there's no way for us to actually target that right.

02:08.130 --> 02:13.350
This just this one word of course we could we could make the H One all that color but I just want that

02:13.350 --> 02:13.950
one word.

02:13.980 --> 02:23.940
So what I'll do is surround that in a span and I'm going to give it a class of text dash primary just

02:23.940 --> 02:24.630
the enjoy.

02:24.630 --> 02:30.240
So this ending span we want to cut that and we want to put that right after enjoy like that.

02:30.450 --> 02:35.990
And then this text primary we'll style it to just have this color and we can put that wherever we want.

02:36.060 --> 02:41.420
You can see down here the history also has that color so we can use that same class down there.

02:41.490 --> 02:48.930
Another thing I want to do is add a class to the paragraph and call it lead because it's bigger than

02:48.930 --> 02:49.880
the rest of the text.

02:49.890 --> 02:58.230
So it'll be it'll be just a larger font size and then the link obviously the link is is formatted like

02:58.230 --> 02:58.790
a button.

02:59.070 --> 03:09.670
So let's give this a class as well of B10 and that should do it as far as each team.

03:09.690 --> 03:14.100
So let's save that and let's go to our CSX.

03:14.100 --> 03:20.990
So let's go down below the nav bar and let's add our styles for the showcase.

03:21.270 --> 03:28.170
So of course we want to style the actual showcase which has an I.D. of showcase I believe right.

03:28.270 --> 03:29.600
Yep right here.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.180
And that's what we want to add the background image to.

03:32.180 --> 03:37.900
So remember background or background image and we want to use U.R.L..

03:38.370 --> 03:41.340
And then the image is located in.

03:41.340 --> 03:45.470
If we look at our file structure it's located in this AMG folder.

03:45.480 --> 03:52.590
Now since we're inside of the CSX folder right were in the style sheet that's inside of the CSX folder

03:52.590 --> 03:59.400
we can't do dot slash AMG slash and then the name.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.870
We have to do dot dot slash because we need to go outside of the CSX.

04:03.870 --> 04:10.260
So the trip the double dot means that we're going outside of the current file and then we want to go

04:10.260 --> 04:16.710
into the image folder and then we want to choose the showcase dot j peg OK a single dot would mean we're

04:16.710 --> 04:23.220
looking in the current for the current folder double is going to mean we want to go outside of the current

04:23.220 --> 04:29.580
folder and then we're just going to add no repeat let's do no repeat.

04:29.580 --> 04:33.810
And then let's do center center.

04:33.840 --> 04:40.280
So this is the the background position and then we wanted to cover the whole thing as well.

04:40.290 --> 04:42.310
So let's save that.

04:42.830 --> 04:43.780
OK.

04:43.950 --> 04:49.340
Now obviously we want the showcase to be we want a bigger height than this.

04:49.350 --> 04:56.490
So I'm gonna set the height to 600 pixels and save good.

04:56.490 --> 04:59.540
So now you can see that it's the same height.

04:59.740 --> 05:04.480
And the reason that when I click over you see how the links move over and stuff that's because of the

05:04.480 --> 05:08.040
scroll bar right here there's no scroll bar here because there's no corn.

05:08.050 --> 05:10.480
It doesn't go down far enough yet.

05:10.510 --> 05:10.870
All right.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.430
So now we want to target the showcase content.

05:14.500 --> 05:22.610
So I'm going to say I.D. showcase and we have a class of showcase dash content.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.540
And first of all I want all the color.

05:25.540 --> 05:29.920
Anything that's inside of there I want to be white except for the link.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.290
The link will have to actually add the color ourselves for that.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.610
And then we want to align everything to the center.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.020
So we want to do text align center.

05:40.270 --> 05:43.930
So if I do that everything gets aligned to the center and let's push everything down.

05:43.930 --> 05:51.840
So I'm going to do a padding top of one hundred and seventy pixels and that pushes everything down.

05:51.850 --> 05:52.200
All right.

05:52.210 --> 05:55.030
Now let's let's work on the H one.

05:55.090 --> 05:56.650
So we'll do a showcase

05:59.020 --> 06:04.140
showcase content and then we want to target the H1.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.540
And I want that to be bigger.

06:07.540 --> 06:14.300
So I'm going to say font size and let's set it to we'll do 60 pixels.

06:14.450 --> 06:14.780
OK.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.670
So save that.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.410
So that's much bigger.

06:17.440 --> 06:29.160
Let's do a line height of say one point two m and then let's do padding.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.760
Actually we don't need to do that because we already have the padding bottom on all of the on H1 H2

06:35.760 --> 06:36.520
to an H.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.670
So we don't need to add that here.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.150
All right.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.570
Now that's the H one.

06:41.650 --> 06:46.760
Let's let's add the Texas primary class.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.190
So remember we added the class of Texas primary.

06:50.210 --> 06:55.580
Now we don't want to put like h 1 Texas primary because I want to be able to use this class absolutely

06:55.580 --> 06:56.050
anywhere.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.670
So it's more of a utility class.

06:57.680 --> 07:05.360
So I'm going to put that up here right under container.

07:05.940 --> 07:06.250
All right.

07:06.250 --> 07:16.450
So Texas primary we're gonna use color and let's see the color that we want is hexadecimal.

07:16.450 --> 07:28.720
It's gonna be F seven C zero eight A OK so same as as the Harvard link right here.

07:28.720 --> 07:35.010
So if I save that now only that word enjoy has that color.

07:35.060 --> 07:38.340
Let's go back down to showcase and finish that up.

07:38.510 --> 07:40.700
So we have the H one.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.920
Now the power graph here.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.210
We want the font size to be larger but remember it has a class of lead.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.360
So actually let's add that up top as well

07:53.750 --> 07:55.670
so right under Texas primary

07:59.110 --> 08:02.600
and let's see I forget the font size I want from lead

08:05.660 --> 08:09.050
you know let's do 18 pixels.

08:09.500 --> 08:17.860
Font size 18 pixels actually looks a little bit bigger than now it's 220

08:20.760 --> 08:21.060
All right.

08:21.090 --> 08:27.510
So font size 20 pixels for the lead class and hopefully guys understand what I mean by utility classes

08:27.510 --> 08:31.230
I mean that these are just classes that will be will use throughout the site.

08:31.230 --> 08:34.230
They're not specific to any specific area.

08:34.330 --> 08:34.630
OK.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.810
Like it's not specific to the showcase or to the now bar we can use them anywhere.

08:39.810 --> 08:47.880
So let's go back down now to the showcase and the showcase paragraph.

08:48.020 --> 08:52.580
Let's see you just want to see if we want to add anything to that.

08:52.610 --> 08:55.730
Let's let's give that some padding bottom actually.

08:55.730 --> 09:03.820
So grab this and put in paragraph or P and let's see.

09:03.890 --> 09:08.080
Let's add padding dash bottom.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.200
Say 20 pixels OK.

09:10.250 --> 09:15.840
Just to push the button or the link down below and you know what.

09:15.850 --> 09:21.820
Let's increase the line height a little bit to here hear we'll say line height for the paragraph.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.030
Let's try one point five.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.640
We'll do seven.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.130
There we go.

09:29.140 --> 09:29.400
All right.

09:29.410 --> 09:32.890
So now let's move on to the link here.

09:32.920 --> 09:39.160
Now this is gonna be another utility class because I want to be able to format links into buttons just

09:39.160 --> 09:42.220
by using that Beatty in class that we added.

09:42.220 --> 09:52.510
So we want to go up above here and go right under lead and let's say dot B10 and let's first of all

09:52.720 --> 09:55.150
display it as an inline block

09:57.780 --> 09:59.020
so save that.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.140
There's gonna be no difference just by doing that.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.390
But we don't want it to go all the way across like a block.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.120
But we also don't want it to be in line.

10:09.990 --> 10:12.740
So let's say font size.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.670
We'll set that to 18 pixels make it a little bigger.

10:16.920 --> 10:23.160
Let's set the color to white and let's set the background

10:26.950 --> 10:27.710
backgrounds.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.890
Gonna be three three three.

10:31.970 --> 10:34.520
Obviously we need some padding here.

10:34.520 --> 10:39.150
So for padding let's do 13 on the top and bottom.

10:39.260 --> 10:41.610
And let's do 20 on the left and right.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.310
Like that.

10:43.000 --> 10:43.940
OK.

10:43.950 --> 10:48.200
And I think the last thing let's make sure that there's no border on any browser.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.700
So let's say border none

10:52.370 --> 10:57.680
because we want to if we have buttons we want to be able to add this to the button as well.

10:57.710 --> 10:58.000
OK.

10:58.010 --> 11:03.080
And buttons by default have borders links don't but buttons do.

11:03.260 --> 11:03.560
OK.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.820
So now when we hover over this we get a pointer.

11:06.830 --> 11:09.860
But again buttons do not if you use a button tag it doesn't.

11:09.860 --> 11:15.980
And we want to be able to add this to those as well so let's make sure we do cursor pointer and then

11:15.980 --> 11:17.160
we want to hover state.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.800
We want it to be this color if we hover over it.

11:19.800 --> 11:29.630
So let's actually copy this color this hexadecimal right here from text primary and let's say B.T. n

11:30.230 --> 11:40.610
Cole and hover and let's set the background to that color and set the color of the text to dark and

11:40.610 --> 11:41.200
save.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.760
And now only hover over it.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.960
We get that color.

11:45.020 --> 11:45.290
All right.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.550
So that's the showcase.

11:48.110 --> 11:51.800
So now let's do the the home info section.

11:51.890 --> 11:53.420
So this right here.

11:53.420 --> 12:00.070
Meaning the the image in this part I'm calling home info and we want this to be a section.

12:00.170 --> 12:06.650
So let's go below the header and you'll see a common theme throughout my projects I usually have a header

12:06.650 --> 12:11.630
at the top and then every other part and the page is going to be a section up until the footer.

12:11.630 --> 12:14.250
Then we'll use the HMO five footer tag.

12:14.330 --> 12:19.330
So let's do section and I usually gives the sections an I.D. that describes them.

12:19.430 --> 12:22.560
So I'm gonna call this home dash info.

12:22.820 --> 12:23.180
All right.

12:23.180 --> 12:29.360
And as far as naming conventions I like to use dashes when I use if I have more than one word inside

12:29.360 --> 12:33.050
of an idea or a class I usually use a dash or a hyphen.

12:33.050 --> 12:37.460
Some people we use underscores OK or some people will even use none.

12:37.460 --> 12:38.650
It's all up to you.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.580
Like I said I like to use dashes.

12:41.990 --> 12:51.560
So inside here let's see I actually want the background of this whole thing to be dark and there's other

12:51.560 --> 12:57.450
parts of the site where I'm going to want that as well so I actually think it's just the foot.

12:57.450 --> 12:57.650
Yeah.

12:57.690 --> 12:58.380
Right here.

12:58.380 --> 13:05.020
So this part I want also to have dark and what I'm going to do is create a utility class called big

13:05.040 --> 13:05.570
dark.

13:05.580 --> 13:10.350
We're gonna have different background utility classes now doing stuff like this.

13:10.350 --> 13:16.170
You don't have to I mean you could just style each individual element like home info with the background

13:16.170 --> 13:23.610
dark and then when I get to this part I could target this and put background whatever triple three which

13:23.610 --> 13:30.170
is the dark gray or we can have nice clean utility classes where if we have if we add onto the website

13:30.270 --> 13:36.330
later if we add more pages we have that class available to us it's almost like using a framework but

13:36.330 --> 13:38.200
it's like it's your own framework.

13:38.280 --> 13:49.230
So I'm going to add a class of B G dash dark and then inside here we're going to need these two sections

13:49.230 --> 13:55.440
or two I'm shouldn't shouldn't say sections with two areas we have one which is going to be an image

13:55.850 --> 14:00.110
a background image and then one which is going to be this area with the text.

14:00.220 --> 14:03.860
So let's go ahead and add in here.

14:03.870 --> 14:06.650
Class of info.

14:06.650 --> 14:08.880
Going to do class of info Dash.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.040
I am G.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.260
And then right under that not within it but under it.

14:13.260 --> 14:17.430
We want to do a class of info dash content.

14:18.500 --> 14:18.980
OK.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.940
So this is the info I am G.

14:20.940 --> 14:26.240
This is the info content and inside the content I'm going to use an H too.

14:26.520 --> 14:35.700
And I'm going to say the experts put a span in here as well to expand with the class of text primary

14:35.970 --> 14:39.390
because in that span we want the history.

14:40.140 --> 14:47.130
So the history and then outside of the span will finish that we'll say of our hotel.

14:47.130 --> 14:49.890
And by the way I know that this doesn't look that great.

14:49.940 --> 14:50.820
It's because it's not.

14:50.820 --> 14:56.510
This is not responsive it's somewhat responsive where we use the max width and stuff like that.

14:56.760 --> 15:03.130
But later on when we talk about media queries and stuff we'll get more into building responsive Web

15:03.120 --> 15:04.760
sites.

15:04.890 --> 15:11.850
So after the H two we're gonna want this text right here which I'm not sure.

15:11.850 --> 15:19.110
I think it's 40 or 40 but I'm not exactly sure so I'm going to copy the exact text and I'm going to

15:19.110 --> 15:25.800
put it in a paragraph and you guys have the finished project in the in the first video of the section

15:25.800 --> 15:26.340
as well.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.400
If you want to copy anything.

15:28.500 --> 15:34.370
All right and then under the paragraph if I make this bigger you'll see we actually have a read more

15:35.880 --> 15:36.970
button here.

15:37.110 --> 15:41.820
So let's go ahead and add a tag and let's do.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.310
Class B10.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.220
And again I want to be able to have we have different buttons this one's dark.

15:47.220 --> 15:57.260
This one is light so I'm going to have it in the utility class of and light in addition to B10 so we

15:57.290 --> 15:58.270
want to do that.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.230
And then this is just going to go.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.320
This will go to the about page as well.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.640
It's not a big side to this.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.970
We don't have too many options here.

16:06.370 --> 16:08.160
And that should be it for the home info.

16:08.170 --> 16:16.900
So if we save that and go back I forgot to put text in here that should say Read more.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.580
And there we go.

16:18.580 --> 16:18.920
All right.

16:18.940 --> 16:23.350
Now let's let's start with the button.

16:23.350 --> 16:28.750
So notice it has all the traits of this one because they both have the class of B10.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.610
The only difference is I want this one to be light.

16:31.780 --> 16:39.790
So we'll go back to our CSX and go up to where we have our Beatty in class and right under the Beatty

16:39.790 --> 16:40.480
in class.

16:40.480 --> 16:46.110
We're gonna do dot Beatty and dash light.

16:46.250 --> 16:49.520
So we have a light version and we're going to set the background

16:52.040 --> 17:01.060
to let's do hexadecimal f for three times and then set the color of the text to dark.

17:01.400 --> 17:07.520
So now if I save that notice said it gets all the traits of the B10 meaning the padding the font size

17:07.520 --> 17:08.750
all that stuff.

17:08.750 --> 17:12.950
It just has a different color.

17:13.070 --> 17:16.330
That should be three three three.

17:16.430 --> 17:16.700
OK.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.240
There we go.

17:19.430 --> 17:23.020
And if we wanted to have a different hover color for the light we could have.

17:23.030 --> 17:25.310
But I'm just going to keep it as is.

17:25.340 --> 17:31.730
OK so now let's let's work on floating the image which we have we have yet but we're going to add a

17:31.730 --> 17:34.450
background image to this div right here.

17:34.490 --> 17:41.340
This info image we want that floated to the left and then we want info content to the right.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.370
So let's go

17:46.380 --> 17:59.510
down below showcase and let's say home info so home dash whips home dash info itself.

17:59.520 --> 18:09.200
I'm gonna give this a height of 400 pixels and that should be all we need for the home info itself.

18:09.210 --> 18:16.800
So for the image we want to do home dash in phone and we want to target the class of info Dash.

18:16.800 --> 18:21.270
I am G and let's add.

18:21.270 --> 18:27.390
Let's see first of all its float it to the left and we want it half and half.

18:27.390 --> 18:34.690
So I'm going to do with 50 percent and then let's give it a background of U.R.L..

18:34.760 --> 18:44.250
We want to go outside of the CSX folder into image and then we want the see we want photo 1 dot J Peg

18:44.780 --> 18:46.280
let's put quotes around this

18:52.020 --> 18:52.540
OK.

18:52.540 --> 18:56.880
And then let's do no repeats.

18:56.890 --> 19:03.970
And then we just want to set a mean height of 100 percent because we want the image to take up the whole

19:03.970 --> 19:05.320
space.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.970
So let's save that.

19:06.970 --> 19:07.530
All right good.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.510
So now let's do the content side.

19:10.510 --> 19:22.280
So home info and we want info dash content and we want to float right.

19:22.390 --> 19:26.770
We want to set the width to 50 percent.

19:26.770 --> 19:33.400
I'm going to set the height to 100 percent and I want to align everything to the center.

19:33.670 --> 19:39.250
So text a line to the center and let's add some padding.

19:39.250 --> 19:43.500
So we'll do 50 top and bottom 30 left and right.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.950
And then let's just do overflow hidden.

19:47.140 --> 19:52.590
So if anything goes outside of it there's no scroll bars and save.

19:52.750 --> 19:53.140
Good.

19:53.140 --> 19:59.770
Now notice how the background is white because the BJP dark class is what's going to handle that.

19:59.770 --> 20:01.600
The background color being dark.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.870
So let's add that as a utility class.

20:05.320 --> 20:11.710
So we're going to go up above here and let's go right here under the Beattie and light and do BJP dash

20:12.320 --> 20:13.620
dark.

20:14.050 --> 20:22.210
And let's say background and we'll set that to 3 3 3 and you want to set the color to be light to be

20:22.210 --> 20:23.740
white.

20:23.740 --> 20:28.360
Now while we're here we might as well add some of the other BJP classes because I want to be able to

20:28.360 --> 20:31.880
do a background light and also a background primary.

20:31.900 --> 20:35.510
Now the primary color in this is this tarnished color.

20:35.530 --> 20:38.100
So I want to be able to have those as background.

20:38.110 --> 20:48.390
So let's copy this and let's do BJP light and see BJP light will be f for.

20:48.460 --> 20:57.550
We want to change the color to 3 3 3 and then BJP primary just like Texas primary up here we have Texas

20:57.550 --> 20:58.140
primary.

20:58.210 --> 21:06.220
So we want the background to be that color which is right here OK.

21:06.240 --> 21:14.470
Now if I save this we get this background dark P.G. dark so the last thing I want to do here is the

21:14.610 --> 21:19.950
the content info the paragraph I just want to add a little bit of padding to the bottom because you

21:19.950 --> 21:22.020
see how close this is.

21:22.310 --> 21:24.990
So I'm going to go back down.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.050
Copy this.

21:28.050 --> 21:35.410
And Cruz target the paragraph and just say patting bottom and let's say 30 pixels.

21:35.490 --> 21:38.700
So that'll push it down and that's it.

21:38.710 --> 21:39.310
There we go.

21:40.300 --> 21:45.100
So this is starting to look pretty good and hopefully things aren't too confusing.

21:45.130 --> 21:52.210
So we basically just have our header our header has our NAV bar and the showcase and then underneath

21:52.210 --> 21:58.450
that we have our home info and then along the way we have some utility classes like Texas primary big

21:58.450 --> 22:01.900
primary Beatty and Beatty and light.

22:02.230 --> 22:06.210
Hopefully you can just kind of see how everything's coming together OK.

22:06.250 --> 22:11.170
So in the next video we're going to work on the three boxes below and we're also going to start to look

22:11.170 --> 22:14.300
at font awesome which is a fantastic service.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.460
Very easy to use.

22:15.460 --> 22:20.740
We just have to include a certain style sheet and then use some certain classes and we can get some

22:20.890 --> 22:22.440
some nice icons.

22:22.450 --> 22:23.950
All right so we'll see you in the next video.
