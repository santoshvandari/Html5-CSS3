WEBVTT

00:00.370 --> 00:03.330
All right guys so now we're going to take a look at forms and inputs.

00:03.330 --> 00:11.330
Now it's important to to understand that with forms on a Web site displaying them is with H Tim Allen

00:11.330 --> 00:12.980
and we can style them with CSX.

00:12.990 --> 00:17.400
But when you submit a form and make it do something like let's say a registration form.

00:17.400 --> 00:23.190
That stuff happens on the back end and that happens with some type of programming language like peach

00:23.190 --> 00:26.750
PEA or Python or JavaScript or something like that.

00:26.760 --> 00:33.180
So just just understand that each team on CSR to display the form but server side programming languages

00:33.450 --> 00:35.850
which you'll learn in another course.

00:35.850 --> 00:39.400
Those that's what is used to actually process the form.

00:39.510 --> 00:39.870
OK.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.940
Even a simple contact form.

00:41.940 --> 00:48.870
Although there are some services that you can use that will basically you can kind of insert a snippet

00:48.870 --> 00:49.530
into your age.

00:49.530 --> 00:55.530
Tim Allen you can use their service to process your form and we may talk about that much later on.

00:55.530 --> 00:59.990
But for now let's go ahead and take a look at creating a form in the different inputs.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.030
So going to create a file called 0 7 underscore forms underscore input dot h t email and go ahead and

01:08.030 --> 01:13.410
put our boilerplate in here we'll change the title to forms and input

01:15.930 --> 01:19.270
and let's go down to the body area and create a form.

01:19.310 --> 01:23.850
Okay so we're gonna use a form tag and notice when I use Emmett to create a form tag it gives us an

01:23.850 --> 01:24.780
action.

01:24.810 --> 01:27.590
This is where the the form is gonna be submitted to.

01:27.930 --> 01:32.400
So you would submit it to a file sometimes it's gonna be a p p file if that's what you're working with

01:32.400 --> 01:38.100
on your server it might be something like a file called process stop P HP where it would take all the

01:38.100 --> 01:45.360
form inputs the values maybe integrate it with a database you can insert the data into a database something

01:45.360 --> 01:46.610
like that.

01:46.650 --> 01:55.860
So here is where we're gonna put our inputs and I'm going to separate our labels and inputs with Divs.

01:55.890 --> 02:01.650
OK so divs are just basically just that divisions if you want to separate your markup and you know in

02:01.650 --> 02:02.790
certain ways.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.190
So I'm gonna put a label in here.

02:04.200 --> 02:10.620
So if I say label tab it'll give me a four attribute and this four attribute you want this to match

02:10.620 --> 02:13.750
the idea of the input and I'll show you why in a second.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.470
So let's say this is gonna be for the user's name we'll put the tex name in here right under it we're

02:19.470 --> 02:25.890
gonna put an input and in this code and emit if I hit enter a tab it's gonna give me a type of text

02:26.160 --> 02:28.770
by default which is what we want right now.

02:28.800 --> 02:35.950
So if I go ahead and save this and let's actually run this in life server you'll see we have a label

02:36.240 --> 02:37.720
and we have our input.

02:37.780 --> 02:45.280
Now if I give this an I.D. of name which is the same value I did for the four attribute I save that

02:45.280 --> 02:48.410
and I click on the label it will actually highlight the form.

02:48.810 --> 02:49.120
OK.

02:49.150 --> 02:54.880
So if you want that functionality then you want to put the four in the I.D. If this doesn't match you'll

02:54.880 --> 02:58.710
see if I click on the label it doesn't actually highlight the form.

02:58.810 --> 03:03.430
It's not something you need to do but if you want that functionality then you want to add both of these

03:04.330 --> 03:10.570
and then a lot of times with inputs you'll have a name attribute which in this case the value just happens

03:10.570 --> 03:11.650
to be name.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.620
But this is what is used on the server side.

03:14.620 --> 03:20.700
So if on the server and like let's say HP you want to grab the value you would use whatever this is.

03:20.740 --> 03:22.440
In this case name.

03:22.630 --> 03:22.950
All right.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.320
So let's move on to create another input here.

03:26.470 --> 03:31.670
So we'll put another div we'll do a label this time let's make this an email.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.570
So we'll put an input in here.

03:34.570 --> 03:40.420
Now with Emmett we can do a colon here and then whatever that type of input and so I want this to be

03:40.420 --> 03:46.030
an email type and if we do that it'll also give us the name I.D. by default.

03:46.030 --> 03:50.390
So we're going to fill this in with email and email.

03:50.470 --> 03:50.800
All right.

03:50.810 --> 03:57.220
And I'll save that and notice it looks just like the text field but it has to actually be an email for

03:57.220 --> 03:59.290
it to for to submit.

03:59.320 --> 03:59.630
OK.

03:59.650 --> 04:06.060
So you can actually easily add validation by just using this type email OK.

04:06.100 --> 04:11.500
It's just client side validation if you're working with a server with like let's say BHP you'd want

04:11.500 --> 04:13.930
to add validation there as well.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.940
So that's an email failed.

04:16.360 --> 04:23.560
And if you want to put your label on a separate line without CSX you could put a line break here.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.450
Let's go and do that.

04:25.450 --> 04:30.270
Just think it just looks a little better like that and we're going to I'm going to show you how to style

04:30.280 --> 04:34.290
form really nice later on it's actually going to be one of our challenges.

04:34.450 --> 04:37.300
So let's go ahead and create another field here.

04:37.300 --> 04:46.600
Let's do a div and label and this is going to be for message and message is gonna be a text area which

04:46.600 --> 04:52.930
is different from a text input like this because it's bigger it's for it's for more content usually

04:52.930 --> 05:00.430
like a message or don't know a bio or something like that and a text area has its own tag which also

05:00.430 --> 05:06.300
has an ending tag and I'm going to get rid of these for a second here and just carve the name and I.D..

05:06.520 --> 05:14.920
So for name let's say a message I.D. will say message and then we don't have to put anything within

05:14.920 --> 05:21.850
the text area tags with if I save that let's put a line break after the label and save it and you'll

05:21.850 --> 05:22.960
see that it's a little bigger.

05:22.960 --> 05:29.200
Now if we want to make this even bigger without without using CSX we can use the calls in roll rows

05:29.230 --> 05:30.310
attribute.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.790
So for calls let's do 50 and save.

05:33.820 --> 05:37.100
So what this is is it's 50 columns going this way.

05:37.150 --> 05:37.500
All right.

05:37.510 --> 05:42.570
If we want to make it bigger vertically then we can use rows.

05:42.730 --> 05:45.940
So we'll say rolls equals five AND SAVE.

05:45.940 --> 05:51.440
And now it's five rows going down and you can make it as big or as small as you want.

05:51.460 --> 05:52.900
So that's a text area.

05:52.900 --> 05:57.100
So these are the main ones like this could this could be a contact form right here.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.250
But there are other ones let's look at a select list.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.300
So again we'll put a div in here.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.640
OK.

06:06.120 --> 06:13.390
And here let's put a select tag with the name and I.D. let's call this gender.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.420
Actually we'll call it sex.

06:15.730 --> 06:18.830
We'll be politically correct here.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.100
So let's say sex.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.840
And actually we want to go inside these select we don't want to do this.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.690
I meant to put a label here.

06:28.030 --> 06:35.960
So it's to label and then inside the select was where we want to put our options if I just save it like

06:35.990 --> 06:41.090
this let's put the text in here we have just an empty select list.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.940
So for each option we want to put an actual option tag with a value.

06:46.160 --> 06:54.630
So in this case we'll say male and then we'll put the text in here and let's just copy this down let's

06:54.980 --> 07:01.680
say female and then we'll just put other as an option as well.

07:03.130 --> 07:03.490
OK.

07:03.520 --> 07:10.270
So now we have a select list with kind of this drop down menu or we can select an option.

07:10.360 --> 07:10.570
OK.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.000
So that is select.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.600
Let's take a look at number.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.830
So have a label and let's let's make this one in age.

07:21.340 --> 07:30.910
We might use this for age and put a line very clear and let's say input and then colon number because

07:30.910 --> 07:32.500
we want it to be the type of number.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.360
And if you don't want to remember these image shortcuts.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.800
Right now if it's too much you don't have to.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.560
It just it will make your life easier in the future.

07:42.400 --> 07:54.130
So for name let's say age and for I.D. age OK if we save that it's gonna look like a text field but

07:54.130 --> 07:58.420
when we click inside of it or when we hover over it actually we get these arrows and we can go ahead

07:58.420 --> 08:02.600
and we can kind of just change just increment and decrease the number.

08:02.640 --> 08:11.080
We can also type in a number and we can't type in any any letters except for e because that can actually

08:11.080 --> 08:12.940
be part of a number.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.280
So that's a number fields.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.650
It's good for ages stuff like that.

08:17.650 --> 08:20.090
Let's take a look at the date type.

08:20.140 --> 08:24.420
So say div we'll do a label and let's make this one.

08:24.430 --> 08:25.480
Birth date

08:30.910 --> 08:42.430
and we'll put a line break at the end here K and we want to do input type of date and we'll say birth

08:42.430 --> 08:50.350
date for the name and birth date for the I.D. save that and it's gonna give us this.

08:50.350 --> 08:51.930
Now there's two ways we can use this.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.110
We can click inside of it.

08:53.110 --> 09:01.290
We can put in like you know like that or we can click this little arrow which will give us this date

09:01.300 --> 09:04.060
picker and we can actually pick a date.

09:04.060 --> 09:10.990
We can go ahead and scroll through the Munch months and years and makes makes it a lot easier to format

09:11.020 --> 09:15.480
dates and it makes the user format in a certain way.

09:15.490 --> 09:19.200
So next let's look at radio buttons.

09:19.270 --> 09:24.520
Create another div here and to label for this let's call it membership.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.720
Maybe this is some kind of sign up form for a membership and there's different levels.

09:29.830 --> 09:37.860
So we're going to do an input for each one with the type of radio we'll call then the name is going

09:37.860 --> 09:40.930
to be the same for each one which will be membership.

09:40.930 --> 09:44.020
But the value is going to be different for each one.

09:44.050 --> 09:49.130
So value let's say we have there's a membership called simple.

09:49.330 --> 09:49.690
All right.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.230
So we'll do what happened here.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.590
Value is going to be simple.

09:54.850 --> 09:58.310
And then the idea will say membership.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.980
So if we want to have more than one radio button we'll just copy this down.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.600
Let's do three times.

10:04.600 --> 10:09.540
Let's say the second membership value is going to be standard.

10:10.270 --> 10:13.750
And then this third one is gonna be let's say Super.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.360
Maybe it's like a hosting package or something like that.

10:16.360 --> 10:23.020
So if we save you'll see that we just have the buttons there's no label and two if we want a label we

10:23.020 --> 10:24.760
just put the text right next to it.

10:24.790 --> 10:28.090
So we'll say simple OK.

10:28.180 --> 10:36.630
We don't we don't even have to do like a label tag or anything standard and super and save.

10:36.640 --> 10:40.810
And there we go so now we can choose one of these.

10:41.230 --> 10:47.440
Now let's say that when you load the page you want one preselected if you want to do that what you can

10:47.440 --> 10:53.680
do is you can take the one you want selected like let's say standard and we can add an attribute here

10:54.040 --> 10:56.150
of checked.

10:56.200 --> 11:01.120
So if I say checked and then it loads the page you'll see that it's automatically going to be checked.

11:01.120 --> 11:06.820
And I forgot to mention with select we can do the same thing let's say we want a female selected on

11:06.820 --> 11:07.650
a select list.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.080
You don't use check to use selected.

11:10.150 --> 11:14.450
So if I save that now notice that female is selected by default.

11:14.620 --> 11:23.290
Also if we want to pre fill a value here like let's say a name we want to a value we can actually add

11:23.290 --> 11:29.660
a value attribute and let's say John Doe and save.

11:30.820 --> 11:36.460
Now sometimes you may want something in here that's not an actual value but kind of like a message like

11:36.520 --> 11:42.430
enter an email or something like that before each team of five we would have to actually use a value

11:42.730 --> 11:47.830
but you would want that to go away when you click in the box so we would have to use javascript to add

11:47.830 --> 11:48.970
that functionality.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.850
But with each team all five came place holder.

11:52.470 --> 11:52.720
OK.

11:52.750 --> 12:01.270
So if we want to add place holder and set that to let's say enter an email and we save.

12:01.270 --> 12:04.150
Now it seems like it's filled like the value.

12:04.150 --> 12:11.260
But notice the text is lighter and if I click inside of it it doesn't like it doesn't go it doesn't

12:11.260 --> 12:16.390
go away but it gives me the cursor at the beginning it's not something that I actually have to delete

12:16.840 --> 12:18.240
which we don't want.

12:18.250 --> 12:21.430
OK so that's a that's a placeholder attribute.

12:21.460 --> 12:26.380
So the last type we want to see was a checkbox which is very similar to a radio button except you can

12:26.500 --> 12:28.150
you can choose multiple options.

12:28.150 --> 12:30.750
Notice with the radio I can only choose one.

12:30.750 --> 12:30.960
OK.

12:30.970 --> 12:36.190
So there's different situations where you might want to use a checkbox in certain situations where you

12:36.190 --> 12:37.360
might want to use a radio.

12:37.360 --> 12:43.600
So I'm going to copy the whole div with the with the membership and let's change this to let's just

12:43.600 --> 12:49.800
say I like this would be like a hobbies I guess or I mean it doesn't matter it's just an example.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.220
Well we want to change all the types here to checkbox.

12:53.230 --> 12:58.990
Now I'm going to show you another little trick if you highlight something like let's say radio and you

12:58.990 --> 13:05.500
want to choose the next thing that matches the next text of radio you can hold control D and it will

13:05.500 --> 13:07.930
choose the next one if you want to choose the next.

13:07.930 --> 13:13.720
Do it again and notice all three are now selected and I can change them all at the same time I'm going

13:13.720 --> 13:21.790
to change them all to checked I'm sorry not checked checkbox like that and then if you hit escape it'll

13:21.790 --> 13:28.960
bring you back to your single cursor or you can just click somewhere else and then for the name I'm

13:28.960 --> 13:33.840
going to double click and highlight and I want to select all the memberships here.

13:34.120 --> 13:40.990
So I'm going to do control D again just to select all of these and I'm going to change it to the likes

13:41.110 --> 13:41.760
like that.

13:42.440 --> 13:42.830
OK.

13:42.850 --> 13:45.420
And then we can escape and there we go.

13:45.460 --> 13:53.650
So we have a checkbox likes for the values I'm going to change this one to say let's say bike and say

13:53.650 --> 13:55.170
this is like a vehicle.

13:55.480 --> 13:59.540
So bike might not be the best example but it's fine.

13:59.660 --> 14:04.790
I want to change that to bike as do car

14:07.810 --> 14:12.400
we want to change the value here too.

14:12.420 --> 14:17.090
Car pride to the values lower.

14:17.430 --> 14:21.150
The value is the actual data that gets sent to the server.

14:21.430 --> 14:24.110
Say boat and I'll change that to boat.

14:24.940 --> 14:26.140
OK so let's save that.

14:26.140 --> 14:31.260
Now we have a checkboxes as I like cards selected by default because we have checked.

14:31.270 --> 14:38.550
I'm going to get rid of that and we can go ahead and we can check as many as we want that.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.210
OK so that is a checkbox.

14:41.220 --> 14:46.650
Now we're going to add a submit button because obviously a form is no good unless you can actually submit

14:46.650 --> 14:48.570
it now with a submit.

14:48.570 --> 14:52.510
You can do a couple of things you can either.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.770
Oh and that's something I want to show you too.

14:54.780 --> 14:57.660
If we have all of these tabbed over we want to bring them back.

14:57.660 --> 15:02.370
We can hold shift and then hit tab and it'll bring it backwards.

15:02.370 --> 15:07.520
So for a submit button we could use an input like this.

15:07.670 --> 15:13.950
We could say input and give it a type of submit and then give it a value which would be the text that's

15:13.950 --> 15:15.570
actually displayed in the button.

15:15.570 --> 15:21.930
So if I save that now we have a button that says submit another way to do it would be to use a button

15:21.930 --> 15:22.470
tag

15:26.700 --> 15:27.850
so we could do.

15:27.850 --> 15:31.410
Button and again give it a type of submit.

15:31.410 --> 15:37.620
And now we would just put the text in the middle like that because input is a self closing tag button

15:37.620 --> 15:38.150
is not.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.070
So you would put the text in the middle.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.880
So that will give us the same thing.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.020
All right.

15:44.340 --> 15:49.230
I'm just going to comment these just so you guys know what is what.

15:49.230 --> 15:50.550
So that's a text input.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.640
This is an e-mail input.

15:53.640 --> 16:01.880
This is a message input not a message a text text area input.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.350
See this is a select

16:06.740 --> 16:07.900
this is a no

16:10.640 --> 16:13.510
this is a date.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.290
Radio

16:19.950 --> 16:28.590
and check box and then this is an input submit.

16:28.690 --> 16:29.030
Okay.

16:29.050 --> 16:32.900
So if you ever need to come back here for reference you can do that.

16:33.020 --> 16:33.790
Sexiest.

16:33.870 --> 16:35.780
This button.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.770
Submit.

16:38.100 --> 16:38.430
Okay.

16:38.460 --> 16:43.830
Now one more thing I want to show you is we can at a reset button that actually comment out one of these

16:43.860 --> 16:49.110
because we don't want to submit buttons but if we want to do a reset we can do button with the type

16:49.170 --> 16:51.920
of reset like that.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.000
We'll put the text reset in here.

16:54.120 --> 17:02.660
And now if I fill some stuff in it's a thirty three and then I hit reset.

17:02.660 --> 17:09.490
It'll clear everything out except for John Doe because we hardcoded that value in here like that.

17:09.550 --> 17:09.900
All right.

17:09.910 --> 17:14.450
So that's how we can create forms and I know that this form is extremely ugly.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.200
I'm going to show you how to style forms when we get to the CSF section.

17:18.220 --> 17:21.520
This is just how we can actually display the fields.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.510
All right guys so that's it.

17:22.510 --> 17:23.800
I'll see you in the next video.
