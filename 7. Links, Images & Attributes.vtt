WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:05.250
All right guys so in this video we're going to look at links and images and what I've done here is I've

00:05.250 --> 00:11.440
put the bra I've made the browser smaller so that I could fit it on the same screen as the as the editors

00:11.490 --> 00:17.850
that we can see what's going on at the same time because we have auto reload with live server and I

00:17.850 --> 00:23.430
won't do this for every video just the ones that where we don't need a lot of real estate in the browser

00:23.460 --> 00:24.230
window here.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.340
So let's go ahead and create a new file.

00:27.360 --> 00:33.000
I'm going to call this 0 5 underscore links underscore images dot HD CML.

00:33.140 --> 00:33.630
All right.

00:33.630 --> 00:39.570
And we're going to close this up to give us some more room and we're gonna generate a boilerplate and

00:40.020 --> 00:45.390
might say boilerplate it just means you know our are our starter template whatever our structure.

00:45.390 --> 00:54.420
So the title I'm gonna say links and images and let's go ahead and let's first start with an external

00:54.420 --> 00:54.750
link.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.770
So if you want to link to another Web site you can do that.

00:58.770 --> 01:03.510
So I'm going to put a paragraph in between all these links actually know what I won't do that because

01:03.510 --> 01:04.690
I want to show you something.

01:05.370 --> 01:09.540
So a link is is represented within a tag.

01:09.540 --> 01:16.760
So I'm going to say a tab or a enter and notice that with V.S. code it gives us this H RF attribute

01:16.770 --> 01:17.510
right away.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.830
And that's because every link needs an H ref attribute because that's the location that you're linking

01:22.830 --> 01:23.670
to.

01:23.670 --> 01:34.770
So in this case let's link to H TTP Google dot com and inside here is what we want to put whatever we

01:34.770 --> 01:39.690
want to click to link like some text or an image or whatever that's what we want to put in here so let's

01:39.960 --> 01:46.120
let's just say click for Google and we'll save this.

01:46.220 --> 01:48.120
We're just going to add a comment here.

01:48.320 --> 01:56.210
We'll say external link and let's go ahead and save and run with live server OK.

01:56.260 --> 01:57.360
So we have this link here.

01:57.370 --> 01:59.050
This is click for Google.

01:59.050 --> 02:03.700
By default it's going to be colored differently it's going to have an underlying and if I click it brings

02:03.700 --> 02:06.780
us to Google now knows it opens in the same tab.

02:06.790 --> 02:12.850
And when you link to an external site like this usually you want to open it in a new tab because you

02:12.850 --> 02:16.980
don't want to do you don't want people to drift away from your Web site.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.330
You're trying to show them something.

02:18.340 --> 02:21.340
But at the same time you want your Web site to stay open.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.640
So what we would do is add a target attribute.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.020
Now I'm going to show you a little another little trick here keyboard trick if you want to copy this

02:29.020 --> 02:35.860
whole line down what you can do is hold shift option or shift all on on windows and then hit the down

02:35.890 --> 02:39.230
arrow and that will just copy that line for you.

02:39.280 --> 02:39.930
OK.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.270
And another tip if you want to see how I'm just going back and forth here one character at a time if

02:46.270 --> 02:53.290
you want to go by by word you can hold down Ault or actually on Windows it's control I believe.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.970
But on a Mac it's option.

02:55.090 --> 02:57.130
And if you hit the the over arrow.

02:57.130 --> 02:59.180
Notice how it goes across the whole word.

02:59.510 --> 02:59.820
OK.

02:59.830 --> 03:06.660
So to go from here to here so you can go across much faster.

03:06.790 --> 03:07.300
All right.

03:07.330 --> 03:11.530
And if you want to go all the way to the beginning you can hit the home key if you want to go all the

03:11.530 --> 03:12.870
way to the end of the line.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.460
You can hit the end key.

03:14.590 --> 03:18.910
So it's very helpful to be able to navigate very quickly like that.

03:20.170 --> 03:26.410
So again like I was saying if we want to open in a different tag we can use the target attribute.

03:26.410 --> 03:29.220
And for a value we want to do underscore blank.

03:29.620 --> 03:29.910
OK.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.420
So we'll save that.

03:31.420 --> 03:37.810
And what I wanted to show you is notice how this the next link here is not on a separate line.

03:37.810 --> 03:43.100
The reason for that is an on a tag is actually what's called an inline element.

03:43.120 --> 03:48.730
So it doesn't knock it onto the next line like if it were a paragraph which is actually a block element

03:49.060 --> 03:51.750
and we're going to talk about inline and block elements.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.580
I think two videos from now.

03:53.650 --> 03:59.080
But I wanted you to know that there are some inline elements and there are some block elements.

03:59.110 --> 04:06.210
Now if I want this on a new line I could put a line break or I could just wrap them in a paragraph tag.

04:06.460 --> 04:06.850
OK.

04:06.850 --> 04:12.280
And another tip is if I want this moved up here I can actually just hold either all it on Windows or

04:12.280 --> 04:13.440
option on a Mac.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.590
And I can just bring it up I can move this line wherever I want.

04:17.590 --> 04:17.980
All right.

04:18.250 --> 04:25.140
So we'll do that and let's put another paragraph tag and we'll bring that up into here.

04:25.150 --> 04:30.970
So now if I save there on separate lines because a paragraph is actually a block level element and if

04:30.970 --> 04:36.230
I click the second one it opens up in a new tab because of the target attribute.

04:36.300 --> 04:36.600
OK.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.600
Because I set it to blank.

04:39.640 --> 04:39.940
All right.

04:39.970 --> 04:46.390
So these are external links usually your links are going to be internal because you're going to be linking

04:46.390 --> 04:53.350
to other pages in your web site like let's say in about page or a services or contact page something

04:53.350 --> 04:54.360
like that.

04:54.370 --> 05:00.040
So since we have these each team all files in the same folder Let's link to one of these.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.840
So we'll link to the 0 4 typography.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.570
So we're going to close that back up.

05:06.440 --> 05:15.640
Let's say internal link put a paragraph and we'll put a an h in a tag with an eight graph that points

05:15.640 --> 05:20.580
to slash meaning the current folder that we're in.

05:20.710 --> 05:21.960
And then with V.S. code.

05:21.970 --> 05:26.280
Notice that it actually shows us the HCM him all files that are in this folder.

05:26.320 --> 05:26.670
Ok.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.020
The slash means the current folder we're in.

05:29.140 --> 05:38.260
So going to choose the topography h t AML and in here let's just say topography and we'll go and save

05:38.260 --> 05:38.980
that.

05:38.980 --> 05:42.490
And then if we click topography it brings us to that page.

05:42.910 --> 05:43.180
OK.

05:43.180 --> 05:50.860
We don't have to put the whole like 1 2 7 0 0 1 fifty five under we don't have to put that in here because

05:50.860 --> 05:52.800
we're already in the same folder.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.630
So we just need that Slash.

05:55.630 --> 05:55.930
All right.

05:55.930 --> 06:01.110
We're just going to click the back button so we can link to any inner page that way.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.450
So now let's take a look at images.

06:03.490 --> 06:09.640
So this is our folder right here HCM all sandbox and I'm gonna just create a new folder here called

06:09.640 --> 06:10.840
images.

06:10.930 --> 06:14.530
Usually you'll see this or they might it might be called I Am G.

06:14.560 --> 06:18.630
A lot of times you'll see that on Web sites and applications.

06:18.790 --> 06:24.220
But in this images folder I'm just going to bring over a sample image which you should have in your

06:24.220 --> 06:28.660
ear if you're HDMI sandbox in the project files.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.800
And I'm going to bring this onto our Web page.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.250
OK.

06:33.280 --> 06:42.820
So I'll go down here and let's say local image I'm seeing local image because it's actually in our folder

06:42.850 --> 06:49.450
it's in it's in our file structure you can also link to remote images that are elsewhere and I'll show

06:49.450 --> 06:55.560
you that in a second but let's go ahead and do an image tag which is I am G and in V.S. mode if I do

06:55.560 --> 06:59.520
I AMG enter a tab it's gonna give me two attributes.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.190
One is the source which is the location of the image and the image name.

07:04.350 --> 07:07.770
And then one is the basically the alternative tax.

07:07.770 --> 07:10.240
So for some reason the image doesn't show up.

07:10.350 --> 07:12.120
If it's not there or something.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.180
This will be the text that's shown.

07:14.220 --> 07:22.050
So for the altar I'll just say my image and then for the for the link here we want to go into the images

07:22.050 --> 07:22.830
folder.

07:22.890 --> 07:29.310
Notice with V.S. code if I do forward slash brings down this dropdown and I can choose the images folder

07:29.640 --> 07:31.360
and it even shows me what's in there.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.930
And the sample dot JPEG.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.350
So I want that.

07:34.440 --> 07:38.370
So the location and the image name itself.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.060
So if I go ahead and save.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.140
There it is.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.810
The image shows up now.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.650
It goes out of view here because we have no CSF.

07:46.670 --> 07:49.350
So it's just going to show the full size image.

07:49.350 --> 07:56.880
But with CSX we can actually change actually we can change with H team as well if I wanted to I could

07:56.880 --> 07:57.960
add a width here.

07:57.990 --> 08:03.060
This isn't really something I'd recommend doing usually you would use CSX but you can set the width

08:03.060 --> 08:05.070
and height in HMO.

08:05.220 --> 08:11.580
So if I set this to two hundred and save now I could see that it's smaller and you can do height the

08:11.580 --> 08:18.390
height as well but the height will auto adjust if you add a width so we can also do remote images

08:22.650 --> 08:25.470
so same way I am G.

08:25.890 --> 08:28.980
And also just say my image too.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.030
And for the source I could do any source I want.

08:33.030 --> 08:36.230
Actually there's a really good image sharing site.

08:36.270 --> 08:46.410
If you go to source dot on Splash dot com and we go down here you can get random images from a specific

08:46.410 --> 08:48.550
user of the site.

08:48.600 --> 08:55.290
What I want though is let's see there's a fixed date daily weekly photo so you could grab any of these

08:55.290 --> 09:02.460
you are ls right here random search term so if you want a random image like of nature and water you

09:02.460 --> 09:06.320
can just grab this you are all and put in nature and water.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.420
So let's do that.

09:09.510 --> 09:15.570
So if we go back if I save it's going to give me an image that sixteen hundred pixels by nine hundred

09:15.570 --> 09:18.720
pixels of nature water let's make this smaller

09:21.320 --> 09:22.410
say two hundred

09:25.900 --> 09:27.870
OK so there we go.

09:27.950 --> 09:32.870
And this only works because the UN splash dot com allows us to do this.

09:32.870 --> 09:38.900
They they basically allow us to specify the size and hear this you can't do this with just any link

09:38.960 --> 09:40.640
any image link.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.980
Same thing with keywords here.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.900
If I wanted like let's say building

09:47.890 --> 09:50.100
and then we go get some kind of picture of a building.

09:50.100 --> 09:50.840
I think it's right.

09:51.210 --> 09:56.300
Yeah it's random so if I click reload it's just going to be a random building.

09:56.370 --> 10:03.750
And again this has nothing to do with h t Amal it's just the UN splash service is an image sharing service

10:03.750 --> 10:07.510
or an image place holder service that allows us to do this.

10:07.530 --> 10:12.150
So it's free it's pretty cool if you're building something and you just need some some kind of random

10:12.150 --> 10:14.790
image and you don't want to have it local.

10:14.790 --> 10:18.210
You can just link to on splash like this.

10:18.210 --> 10:18.560
All right.

10:18.570 --> 10:24.210
So I think that's going to do it guys in the next video we're gonna start to look at lists and tables.
