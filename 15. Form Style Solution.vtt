00:00.260 --> 00:07.650
All right guys in the last video I give you an assignment with some HD Himmel of a form and a bunch

00:07.650 --> 00:13.410
of classes and ideas with some hints inside your CSX and your styling.

00:13.410 --> 00:18.780
So in this video I'm going to go through and I'm going to add my styling and don't worry if yours doesn't

00:18.780 --> 00:21.640
match the you know my exact CSF.

00:21.660 --> 00:22.420
That's fine.

00:22.920 --> 00:30.630
So let's start off with the asterisk here so as the hint says we might want to add Border box for the

00:30.630 --> 00:33.630
box sizing property so the padding doesn't affect the width.

00:33.630 --> 00:37.930
We also want to reset the margin and padding that's pretty self-explanatory.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.830
So let's go ahead and set border.

00:40.860 --> 00:41.280
I'm sorry.

00:41.280 --> 00:50.010
Box sizing to border box and let's clear out the margin and padding on everything

00:52.910 --> 00:53.470
OK.

00:53.490 --> 00:54.460
So I'll save that.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.810
Now all the margin in padding is removed.

00:57.750 --> 01:03.470
So we used railway for the font as you can see it's already bringing it's already brought in here.

01:03.520 --> 01:08.370
So let's go ahead and actually I'll put that back.

01:08.880 --> 01:20.320
Let's set the font family and we want to set that to railway and sans serif.

01:22.160 --> 01:22.750
OK.

01:22.770 --> 01:23.610
We'll save that.

01:23.610 --> 01:30.540
Now we have our font and the hint there is the background color which is that hexadecimal value so it's

01:30.540 --> 01:34.920
too background to do background or background color.

01:34.930 --> 01:40.920
I'm going to set it to three four for a seven to save that.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.360
There we go.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.830
So we should also.

01:45.060 --> 01:45.790
Actually no we don't.

01:45.940 --> 01:46.120
Yeah.

01:46.140 --> 01:51.380
We'll set the color to white here.

01:51.900 --> 01:58.370
We are going to have that white form wrap but we can just change the font color in there.

01:58.380 --> 02:03.150
And then the last thing I want to do here is set the line height too.

02:03.150 --> 02:05.220
Let's do one point eight

02:08.370 --> 02:12.990
OK so let's see underlines our ugly.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.220
So let's remove that.

02:14.220 --> 02:16.960
Remember text decoration.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.190
Want to set that none that will get rid of all the underlines.

02:21.270 --> 02:25.410
Let's go to our container so remember we want to center the form.

02:25.530 --> 02:33.120
So we want to use margin auto and we also want to set a max width and we may want to add some padding

02:33.120 --> 02:35.110
so let's let's go ahead and do that.

02:35.130 --> 02:42.820
So going to set the margin to auto but on the top and bottom I'm going to set 30 pixels just to move

02:43.140 --> 02:45.110
the container down a little bit.

02:45.750 --> 02:46.030
OK.

02:46.070 --> 02:52.160
We'll set a max width and it's a pretty thin or narrow form.

02:52.170 --> 02:56.480
So we're going to set this to 400 pixels.

02:56.880 --> 03:03.650
OK and then let's set the margin.

03:03.750 --> 03:11.310
I'm sorry not the margin clarity that want to set the padding to 20 pixels and save that.

03:12.690 --> 03:13.070
OK.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.290
So next we have the form wrap.

03:15.290 --> 03:19.830
This is the white area around the form in the heading and all this.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.450
So let's go ahead and do that.

03:21.480 --> 03:28.990
Let's say background let's set that to white and then for padding.

03:29.180 --> 03:36.970
I'm going to set that to 15 pixels on the top and bottom and 25 on the left and right.

03:37.130 --> 03:45.800
So since our text is white our body text we want to change the color of this form wrap text.

03:45.830 --> 03:48.290
So let's change that to 3 3 3

03:51.130 --> 03:52.650
OK so that's our form.

03:52.660 --> 03:56.460
Now let's move on to the H1 in paragraph.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.490
We want to center these.

03:57.490 --> 04:04.130
So we want to use the text align and we want to set that to center.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.710
We don't want to center everything.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.380
That's why I didn't add it to the form right.

04:07.390 --> 04:13.750
We don't want these the inputs and stuff centered we just want the heading in the paragraph centered.

04:13.770 --> 04:14.080
All right.

04:14.110 --> 04:18.490
So each label input is wrapped in form group.

04:18.490 --> 04:24.890
So what I'm going to do is just add a margin top to each form group.

04:25.260 --> 04:28.890
So margin top let's do 15 pixels.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.320
OK just push him push each one down.

04:33.550 --> 04:37.180
So for the label we want that to be displayed as a block level element.

04:37.210 --> 04:46.480
So let's use the display property set that to block and I'm going to change the color to Let's do triple

04:46.480 --> 04:54.220
six and save OK so for the inputs they should go all the way across.

04:54.310 --> 04:55.960
By default they don't.

04:56.110 --> 05:00.310
And then we also want them to have some padding because they're much too skinny right now.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.910
So let's do that.

05:01.930 --> 05:05.840
Let's say we want the with to be 100 percent.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.500
We want it to go all the way across.

05:07.510 --> 05:11.710
And let's add 10 pixels padding to each input.

05:11.710 --> 05:21.960
Let's also set the border to Let's do DDD one pixel solid and let's give it a kind of a rounded border

05:21.970 --> 05:27.240
so we'll say border radius and let's do just five pixels for each one.

05:27.250 --> 05:31.810
OK so that makes these the inputs look much cleaner.

05:31.810 --> 05:31.990
All right.

05:31.990 --> 05:37.510
Next we have the button so button should wrap across 100 percent in display as block background color

05:37.510 --> 05:38.020
is this.

05:38.020 --> 05:51.410
So let's first of all just grab that and set the background to that and get rid of that and let's set

05:52.190 --> 05:56.820
the display to block OK.

05:56.970 --> 06:00.560
So save that and then we want it to go all the way across.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.300
So let's do a width of 100 percent OK.

06:04.370 --> 06:08.090
Now you can see it goes all the way across we need some padding here.

06:08.090 --> 06:12.850
So it's two padding 10 pixels all the way around.

06:12.950 --> 06:15.550
We want to bring it down from the from the top input.

06:15.560 --> 06:21.410
You can see it's kind of stuck to it right now so let's do a margin top member margin is the outside.

06:21.410 --> 06:24.860
So we'll do 20 pixels push it down.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.170
Let's also make the color of the text white.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.230
So we'll see a color

06:32.870 --> 06:35.930
white and what else.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.740
Let's do.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.090
Let's see.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.810
I think that's that's good.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.940
Let's change the pointer to a car serve notice that if we go over a button doesn't change to a cursor

06:47.290 --> 06:50.790
we want that to happen so we'll say cursor pointer.

06:50.790 --> 06:57.680
And now when we have rover it we get the the cursor or I'm sorry the pointer.

06:57.890 --> 06:59.990
All right so let's see what we have next.

06:59.990 --> 07:01.060
The hover.

07:01.820 --> 07:07.550
So I wanted to to have kind of a different color or just get a bit lighter on the hover and you can

07:07.550 --> 07:13.970
see I actually gave you the hexadecimal value here so we're just going to go ahead and add the background

07:15.950 --> 07:17.240
and make it that color.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.090
So now if I have rover it it actually gets darker.

07:21.110 --> 07:21.370
All right.

07:21.400 --> 07:29.240
So the bottom tax which is this right here we want to make that smaller so the default remember is 16

07:29.240 --> 07:34.430
pixels so let's set the font size here to 13 pixels.

07:34.610 --> 07:42.440
And I'm also going to move it down a bit by doing a margin top of 20 pixels.

07:42.910 --> 07:44.270
Next thing is the footer.

07:44.270 --> 07:46.990
So this right here we want this to be centered.

07:46.990 --> 07:48.690
We also want to push it down a little bit.

07:48.700 --> 07:55.460
So let's say text align center.

07:56.350 --> 08:02.520
And let's do see the colors find for the text.

08:03.010 --> 08:08.780
Let's do margin dash top and let's move it down 10 pixels.

08:08.870 --> 08:11.070
OK so now it's centered it's moved down.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.250
Last thing is the link.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.900
So I gave you the color for the link.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.340
So we're gonna change that.

08:16.430 --> 08:20.210
That's a color and we want.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.280
What happened.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.150
There we go.

08:24.140 --> 08:27.270
So paste that in and save and that's it.

08:27.280 --> 08:32.860
So don't get discouraged if you don't have this exact CSX or if you couldn't do it or if you can only

08:32.860 --> 08:35.270
do part of it that's absolutely fine.

08:35.440 --> 08:40.630
If you if you're just getting into CSX then this this is kind of a tough project.

08:40.630 --> 08:47.110
So we're going to move on and in the next section what I want to do is take what we've learned in the

08:47.110 --> 08:52.890
H T mail section as well as this one and build an actual Web site an actual project.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.200
OK.

08:53.230 --> 08:59.200
So we're gonna build a small hotel Web site that has you know a home page and about page contact page

08:59.210 --> 09:06.000
and we're going to style the navigation menu and add some background images so we'll actually get to

09:06.160 --> 09:09.340
to put something together with everything that we've learned so far.

09:09.340 --> 09:09.600
All right.

09:09.610 --> 09:10.990
So I'll see you in the next section.
