00:00.390 --> 00:07.080
All right so in the last video we looked at how to create a grid and how to deal with the grid template

00:07.080 --> 00:08.090
columns property.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.770
Now there's also a grid template Rose property.

00:10.830 --> 00:15.450
Now we're going to we're going to look at that we're also going to talk about the implicit grid or implicit

00:15.450 --> 00:16.180
rows.

00:16.200 --> 00:25.170
So let's create a new file here called Zero to underscore grid underscore Rose dot H PML and I'm going

00:25.170 --> 00:30.720
to actually copy what we have in the grid columns file because there's gonna be some some things that

00:30.720 --> 00:38.550
are similar so paste that in and we'll change the title here and let's get rid of everything in this

00:38.550 --> 00:40.950
grid class except for display grid.

00:40.950 --> 00:43.090
I want to keep the items styling.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.270
Get rid of Main.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.120
We don't want that.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.830
We don't want this main down here.

00:46.830 --> 00:53.670
I just wanted to show you how easy it was to create a basic main main area and sidebar but we're gonna

00:53.670 --> 00:57.580
keep this here and let's open this with live server.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.050
All right.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.880
So remember with Flex blocks we have a row and a column.

01:02.910 --> 01:07.970
We can set flex direction to either row or column with the grid we have.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.190
We also have rows and columns.

01:10.350 --> 01:23.040
So I'm going to go ahead and set grid dash template rows and let's set this to we'll do one at far too

01:23.190 --> 01:24.170
far.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.610
Three F5.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.920
OK so I'm going to save this and let's see what we get here.

01:28.920 --> 01:36.720
So as you can see there they're vertical OK so it's not we're not adding columns here so it's not going

01:36.720 --> 01:38.290
horizontally.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.890
And the first one is one far.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.090
Second is to a fire.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.670
Third is three IFR.

01:43.860 --> 01:44.100
OK.

01:44.130 --> 01:49.830
If I were to add another one here and go for I fire the next one will be for fire.

01:49.850 --> 01:56.310
But notice the ones that are remaining where we don't add a specific value for they're just going to

01:56.310 --> 01:58.920
stay the same they're all going to look like this.

01:58.920 --> 02:05.580
This is actually called the implicit grid are implicit rows because we didn't we didn't manually set

02:05.580 --> 02:06.020
them.

02:06.030 --> 02:13.920
In fact I'm going to take this one off and there's actually another property we can use if we want to

02:13.920 --> 02:17.880
set these to something different and that's grid auto rows.

02:18.150 --> 02:18.420
OK.

02:18.450 --> 02:27.710
So if we say grid dash auto dash rows we can set this to let's say we want the rest of them to be three

02:27.710 --> 02:31.650
FIA as well just like the last one that we put here.

02:31.830 --> 02:35.050
So we can say three IFR and save.

02:35.070 --> 02:38.100
And now the rest of them are all three IFR.

02:39.390 --> 02:39.690
All right.

02:39.720 --> 02:48.360
Now unlike flex blocks the grid is multi-dimensional so we can we can use grid template rows along with

02:48.480 --> 02:50.050
grid template columns.

02:50.160 --> 03:00.600
So just to show you that let's say grid dash template dash columns and let's say we want to do let's

03:00.600 --> 03:04.470
do repeat we'll just have to.

03:04.470 --> 03:08.220
So we'll say repeat 2 and let's do one.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.320
FDR did they spell wrong here

03:15.270 --> 03:16.830
OK so we'll save that.

03:16.830 --> 03:22.900
And now you can see that we have our columns which is just to one F.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.660
So the columns are even.

03:24.750 --> 03:30.090
But then we're also we also have our rows which are one at far too far and three or far and this is

03:30.090 --> 03:32.140
this will still be in effect.

03:32.250 --> 03:37.990
So if I were to add extras down here and save you'll see that those will all be three f.

03:39.090 --> 03:39.360
All right.

03:39.360 --> 03:44.130
And if I wanted three rows or three columns I could do that as well.

03:44.130 --> 03:52.350
So you can really create the layout that you want and you can span items across multiple rows and columns

03:52.350 --> 03:54.740
and I'm going to show you how to do that as well.

03:54.750 --> 03:55.000
All right.

03:55.020 --> 03:57.550
But that is grid template rows.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.350
So that's it.

03:58.350 --> 03:59.580
I'll see you in the next video.
