00:00.620 --> 00:03.300
All right so now we're gonna deal with these buttons here.

00:03.320 --> 00:06.990
OK so I'm going to just get rid of this a tag here with the hover.

00:06.990 --> 00:13.740
I just wanted to give you an example of that how to use sudo selectors within your nested elements or

00:13.740 --> 00:15.210
nested styles.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.780
Now these buttons are going to share a lot.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.040
Okay.

00:18.060 --> 00:23.820
So they're going to share like the padding in the border and you know cursor pointer or all that stuff.

00:23.820 --> 00:28.920
What we were doing before is we'd have a Beatty in class with all that stuff and then also a Beatty

00:28.920 --> 00:33.220
and dark t and light that have to do with the color.

00:33.240 --> 00:33.630
OK.

00:33.630 --> 00:40.280
So instead of doing that I'm going to create a style a set of styles to be extended.

00:40.290 --> 00:48.040
So to do that we use a percent sign and we're just going to do t n dash shared.

00:48.090 --> 00:48.450
All right.

00:48.450 --> 00:53.600
And then all the the core styles that we want to share I'm going to put in here like display inline

00:53.680 --> 00:55.400
block.

00:56.460 --> 01:04.480
Let's do padding C zero point seven ram to ram.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.700
Let's do what else.

01:07.710 --> 01:15.490
It's to a border non pointer should be a cursor

01:18.950 --> 01:19.730
spell wrong

01:22.150 --> 01:24.780
pointer cursor.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.230
I don't know why it's not popping up

01:29.180 --> 01:31.990
I did it backwards.

01:32.030 --> 01:34.760
Be cursor pointer.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.500
Brain fart.

01:37.850 --> 01:38.480
Let's do.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.860
Text.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.320
Declaration.

01:41.330 --> 01:42.650
None.

01:42.650 --> 01:44.660
And let's just do a margin.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.510
Top one room.

01:47.510 --> 01:47.840
All right.

01:47.870 --> 01:55.880
Now the styling here I want to use for both buttons light dark and if we had other ones I want I would

01:55.880 --> 01:57.110
want to use it as well.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.800
So I'm gonna go down here and let's do B T N.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.060
Now we don't have a B10 class we just have beaten light and dark.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.350
However I'm gonna use this type of nesting.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.230
I'm gonna say Ampersand dash light.

02:12.750 --> 02:18.590
OK so this will pertain to any B10 light and I want to extend the button shared so to do that we use

02:18.590 --> 02:23.350
Ampersand extend and then we want to put in here.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.880
Percent Beatty and shared like that.

02:27.620 --> 02:27.980
All right.

02:28.010 --> 02:32.330
And then I'm going to go right below it and do the same thing for dark

02:35.040 --> 02:42.790
so we want to extend and we want PETN shared.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.220
All right.

02:43.230 --> 02:47.480
So I'm gonna save this and it gets all of that all these properties.

02:47.500 --> 02:52.680
Okay so the padding board or non cursor all that stuff.

02:52.770 --> 02:58.280
What we want to change between these is the color the background color as well as the text color.

02:58.740 --> 03:07.320
So I'm going to add background color for the light is gonna be our variable of light color and then

03:07.320 --> 03:15.420
for the text or the color I'm just gonna put in this do three 3 3.

03:15.630 --> 03:19.230
So we want a dark text and then down here let's do

03:21.990 --> 03:23.010
background

03:25.520 --> 03:34.940
color and we'll set that to dark color and for color we'll say F F F and I'm not using variables here

03:34.940 --> 03:40.070
because I'm going to show you in the next section when we deal with functions we're gonna have a function

03:40.070 --> 03:44.200
that automatically sets the text color based on the background color.

03:44.450 --> 03:45.430
So let's save that.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.060
And there we go.

03:46.060 --> 03:52.880
So now you can see we have the different colors now again if you don't like this syntax here you could

03:52.880 --> 04:01.730
of course instead just do like Beatty and dash lights and then you could just take this and put it in

04:01.730 --> 04:06.470
here and then you could do down here VTR n dash dark.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.540
So I mean it's up to you what parts of sass you want it.

04:09.630 --> 04:13.190
You want to use I like this because it's all encapsulated.

04:13.190 --> 04:18.260
However if you don't like the look of this Ampersand or whatever you can just do it like this and you

04:18.260 --> 04:21.080
can still extend the button shared.

04:21.260 --> 04:21.680
All right.

04:21.710 --> 04:24.350
So hopefully that makes sense.

04:24.350 --> 04:27.900
So in the next video I'm going to show you.

04:28.250 --> 04:34.070
I'm going to we're going to look at functions mix ins which are similar to functions as well as conditionals

04:34.400 --> 04:35.740
and color functions.

04:35.740 --> 04:41.540
And the reason I'm doing all that in one video is because we're going to create probably the most helpful

04:42.380 --> 04:50.540
SAS function that in my experience which is one that will look at the background color of an element

04:50.930 --> 04:57.110
and depending on the the the brightness of it or the lightness or darkness it'll set the text color

04:57.140 --> 04:58.380
automatically.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.000
OK.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.610
So if it's dark it'll be a light tax if it's light it'll be dark text.

05:03.610 --> 05:07.730
So we're going to create that function and do some other stuff as well.

05:07.730 --> 05:07.960
All right.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.170
So I'll see you in the next video.
