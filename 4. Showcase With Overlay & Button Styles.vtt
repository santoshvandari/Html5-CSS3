WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:06.180
OK so in the last video we created our core styles with our variables of the primary color secondary

00:06.180 --> 00:07.260
color and so on.

00:07.260 --> 00:08.560
We also did the now via.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.490
So now we're gonna move on to the showcase so let's head back over to the HD CML.

00:12.570 --> 00:19.170
Let's go under the NAV here and let's add our showcase.

00:19.410 --> 00:19.810
OK.

00:19.850 --> 00:26.520
So we're going to use a header here with the I.D. of showcase.

00:26.590 --> 00:33.130
Now I want to put everything into the metal here so we're going to use a container.

00:33.130 --> 00:39.760
But I don't want to use the actual container here for the for the grid container so I'm going to create

00:40.180 --> 00:45.050
another class called showcase dash container.

00:45.430 --> 00:49.540
And inside here we're gonna just have one grid item.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.060
So I'm going to use it.

00:51.070 --> 00:55.690
I mean use the grids to just align it over to the side like this.

00:55.800 --> 01:02.620
So which I probably would normally use flex for but I just like I said in the last video I want to keep

01:02.620 --> 01:03.970
this focused on the grid.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.530
So we're gonna do that.

01:06.610 --> 01:14.920
So we're gonna have one grid item and we're gonna call this showcase dash content and inside here we're

01:14.920 --> 01:16.810
gonna have the category.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.570
So this right here this little sports.

01:19.570 --> 01:22.310
So that's gonna have a class of category.

01:22.540 --> 01:29.440
And we're also going to have to basically category is the core styling like the padding the border radius

01:29.620 --> 01:32.650
but then the color is dependent on the category.

01:32.650 --> 01:37.180
So we're gonna have a class called category sports.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.870
And then here we'll just say sports.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.010
OK.

01:41.020 --> 01:46.740
And underneath the category let's put the title so this is gonna be an H1.

01:46.900 --> 01:59.020
And let's just say some sports article and then a paragraph and I think I did last 20 seems about right.

01:59.020 --> 02:06.010
And then underneath the paragraph we want a link and we're gonna give this a class of B.T. n which would

02:06.010 --> 02:12.010
be the core Button class and then B10 primary which will be the primary colors so we'll have to set

02:12.010 --> 02:17.340
those up and we'll just have this go to Article dot H terminal.

02:18.870 --> 02:19.150
All right.

02:19.150 --> 02:20.280
So that's the.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.950
We've got to put the text in here.

02:21.950 --> 02:24.540
Let's put read more.

02:24.650 --> 02:26.350
OK so that's the markup.

02:26.350 --> 02:27.760
Now let's add the CSF.

02:27.790 --> 02:36.250
So we'll go to style and let's go right here and say showcase.

02:36.970 --> 02:42.030
So the showcase itself let's do color white.

02:42.040 --> 02:42.280
OK.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.470
It's gonna have a it's gonna have the image background but the background.

02:47.470 --> 02:54.820
We're gonna put on the before pseudo selector if you remember in when we did the the the lecture on

02:54.820 --> 03:02.110
after and before I showed you how to add a background image with an overlay using the before selector.

03:02.110 --> 03:07.450
So for the actual showcase I want the background to be dark.

03:07.450 --> 03:22.300
So let's use 3 3 3 and we're gonna just add padding of to ram all around and let's do position relative.

03:22.300 --> 03:29.490
And that's important because the before Sol the before pseudo selector is gonna be position absolute.

03:29.530 --> 03:35.590
And remember if you position something absolute it is positioned inside inside of the first relative

03:35.590 --> 03:39.410
container so that we want that to be our showcase.

03:39.550 --> 03:51.780
So let's save that and let's go right below when let's add showcase and we're gonna do before.

03:52.210 --> 03:52.390
Okay.

03:52.450 --> 03:57.820
Now when used before and after you want to put in the content in when not actually inserting content

03:57.850 --> 04:03.060
so we're just going to leave this blank and then we want to add our background image here.

04:03.070 --> 04:10.390
So let's say background you are L thoughts slash you want to go outside of the CSX into image and then

04:10.390 --> 04:19.360
we want featured and we're gonna do no repeats center center slash cover

04:22.280 --> 04:22.620
all right.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.690
That's not gonna show just yet.

04:24.900 --> 04:31.590
Let's position this absolute because we're basically laying this on top of the showcase.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.050
OK.

04:32.070 --> 04:37.620
So position absolute start at the top zero and the left zero.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.450
And then we want the width to go all the way across.

04:40.470 --> 04:42.680
We want the height to go all the way.

04:42.690 --> 04:43.860
So hundred percent.

04:44.970 --> 04:52.740
And we also want to make it translucent or transparent so let's add an opacity of let's say zero point

04:52.860 --> 04:55.830
four and save.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.280
All right.

04:56.280 --> 05:03.210
So now you can see the the image has has an overlay or it's it's not really an overlay on the image

05:03.210 --> 05:09.080
it's basically the image you can see through it to the dark eyes basically what's happening.

05:09.210 --> 05:13.170
You can also see through the text right now but we'll fix that in a little bit.

05:13.170 --> 05:27.730
So let's let's grab on to the showcase container so we'll see a showcase in the class of showcase container.

05:28.710 --> 05:33.180
And we want to display as a grid.

05:33.180 --> 05:37.990
And then the grid template columns.

05:37.990 --> 05:45.480
I wanted to take up half the space basically so we're gonna just repeat two times one far.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.340
OK.

05:46.370 --> 05:50.530
We want it to be a two column grid even though we only have one item that's fine.

05:50.570 --> 05:56.610
It should just it should still make room for just just an empty item basically.

05:56.610 --> 06:02.520
And then after that let's justify content to the center.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.930
So this whole center it's

06:06.990 --> 06:13.080
horizontally and then we want to center it vertically as well so a line items center and then let's

06:13.080 --> 06:16.160
make the height of the showcase half the viewport.

06:16.170 --> 06:22.410
So 50 VH and we'll go ahead and save that and then we go actually know what I wanted some more more

06:22.410 --> 06:31.170
text than that let's do for the paragraph what's to Lorem 40.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.520
Yeah it's a little too much.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.060
I think 30 is what I did.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.210
There you go.

06:37.230 --> 06:37.610
OK.

06:37.620 --> 06:42.180
So notice that the the text here you can see through it.

06:42.210 --> 06:49.590
So basically the image is on top of the text and remember z index takes care of of what displays first.

06:49.590 --> 06:53.610
And basically the order of of what is on top of what.

06:53.610 --> 07:01.980
So let's take the showcase and take the not the showcase container we want the showcase content which

07:01.980 --> 07:09.810
wraps all the text and let's set the z index to one and save and now you can see that it becomes clearer

07:09.810 --> 07:12.250
and it's it's now on top of the image.

07:12.550 --> 07:15.010
OK let's see.

07:15.600 --> 07:23.580
So I think I mean that's pretty much it for the core showcase styles but we do want to add the category

07:23.660 --> 07:27.150
that we need some styling for that as well as the button which you can't even see.

07:27.270 --> 07:34.410
But those are gonna be utility classes that we can apply it in other places as well so let's go up here

07:34.410 --> 07:43.230
to where we have our utilities and let's do the category so we'll say category.

07:45.790 --> 07:46.400
OK.

07:46.400 --> 07:57.860
So for category I'm going to display as inline block and let's make the color white.

07:57.860 --> 08:03.000
I'm not going to do a back to the background is dependent on the category so we're not going to do that

08:03.000 --> 08:03.940
here.

08:03.940 --> 08:09.780
But let's change the font size I actually want to make it smaller so we'll do fifty point five five

08:09.780 --> 08:11.180
REM units.

08:11.370 --> 08:17.620
And I want it to be uppercase so let's say text transform to uppercase.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.800
And as far as padding goes will do zero point four REM.

08:21.840 --> 08:27.240
So that's the top and bottom and zero point six REM on the left and right.

08:27.300 --> 08:27.630
All right.

08:27.630 --> 08:38.310
And then for the border dash radius let's do 15 pixels make it rounded and then add a margin or a margin

08:38.310 --> 08:44.050
bottom rather of we'll do a half around.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.690
So we'll save that.

08:46.350 --> 08:46.710
OK.

08:46.710 --> 08:48.720
Now notice it doesn't have a color around it.

08:48.750 --> 08:54.720
So what we're going to do is add our special category colors so these two categories sports

08:57.000 --> 09:00.600
and I'll just do one line since just one property.

09:00.600 --> 09:07.560
So background is gonna be var cat.

09:08.190 --> 09:13.790
What do we call it c o sports color.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.720
So we'll do dash dash sports color and save.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.710
And there we go.

09:19.710 --> 09:25.170
So while we're at it though we might as well add the other categories so we also have E.A. for entertainment

09:25.200 --> 09:31.350
and we have tech and we'll change this to EMT and tech.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.680
OK so now when we add our other categories the styles should be set.

09:35.550 --> 09:37.780
Now the button we want to do that next.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.990
So it's a veto pen.

09:41.100 --> 09:48.400
So we'll have B10 and then we'll have special B10 for the colors as well special classes for the colors.

09:48.450 --> 09:58.470
So for the core button let's display as an inline block let's do a year's in line Dash.

09:58.480 --> 10:04.530
BLOCK And then we want to take away the border just in case we use this on an actual button.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.200
So we'll say border none.

10:06.360 --> 10:10.920
And then the background just by default I'm gonna use the dark color.

10:10.930 --> 10:16.550
So we'll see a var dash dash dark.

10:16.560 --> 10:21.510
Just in case you do B10 and without another special class for the color.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.740
So we'll do that.

10:22.740 --> 10:33.330
And then let's do color white by default in our padding which will be point five REM top and bottom

10:33.330 --> 10:34.840
one point five.

10:35.100 --> 10:35.940
Left and Right.

10:35.940 --> 10:39.270
So we'll save that.

10:39.360 --> 10:49.880
Let's see I actually want to push that down a little bit so where our showcase is

10:54.120 --> 11:05.490
let's do let's grab the paragraph that's in the showcase content and let's add margin bottom one room

11:06.540 --> 11:08.660
just to move that down a little bit.

11:08.700 --> 11:08.970
All right.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.460
So back to the buttons.

11:10.470 --> 11:17.580
We have the core button style but we need to do B10 and we're gonna have a B10 light.

11:17.580 --> 11:23.640
I'm just gonna do all the colors now soon off to worry about it which I'll just put this on the same

11:23.640 --> 11:24.960
line like this.

11:24.960 --> 11:31.890
So background is going to be the variable of light color.

11:31.890 --> 11:32.170
All right.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.450
They're going to copy this down.

11:33.460 --> 11:38.040
Let's see we have we have light dark.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.830
Actually we don't need dark because it's dark by default.

11:40.830 --> 11:56.350
So we'll just do primary and secondary K so primary this will be our primary color and then secondary.

11:56.400 --> 11:56.730
All right.

11:56.760 --> 12:03.450
So save that and I can see we have our red button now for the hover.

12:04.120 --> 12:09.640
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to have one hover and I'm just going to make.

12:09.640 --> 12:14.180
I'm just gonna add the opacity of zero point nine that way.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.220
It doesn't matter what color it is.

12:16.240 --> 12:21.820
It'll still have an effect when you hover over it and it doesn't mean you know if it's even if it's

12:21.820 --> 12:28.180
dark or light it's just going to change the opacity just to give it a little bit of an effect of darkening.

12:28.180 --> 12:34.250
But really it's just it's just we're changing the opacity we're making it a little bit transparent.

12:34.600 --> 12:40.720
And then I want to have one more class for the button that will make it into a block level button meaning

12:40.720 --> 12:42.360
it goes all the way across.

12:42.370 --> 12:49.270
So we're actually gonna do button or Beatty and dash block where we set it to display block instead

12:49.270 --> 12:53.570
of inline block and we set the width to 100 percent.

12:53.710 --> 12:56.170
And I want to align to the middle.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.160
So text align center.

12:58.700 --> 12:59.100
Okay.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.750
So now our buttons should be all set.

13:01.750 --> 13:07.270
All right we're gonna have quite a few utility classes in this project which is nice because you can

13:07.270 --> 13:11.760
easily change things up if you want to change the background of something.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.570
It's it's easy to do.

13:13.570 --> 13:14.270
All right.

13:14.350 --> 13:14.890
So that's it.

13:14.920 --> 13:21.700
I will see you in the next video where we will create we'll start to create this grid right here with

13:21.700 --> 13:22.990
all of the articles.
