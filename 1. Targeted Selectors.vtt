00:00.170 --> 00:06.000
All right guys so in this section we're gonna start to look at I guess more advanced parts of CSX or

00:06.300 --> 00:12.420
things that you're not going to use as much they're not as common but you should still know.

00:12.540 --> 00:18.840
And in this video we're going to look at targeted selectors or just different ways of selecting elements

00:18.850 --> 00:19.950
then we've already learned.

00:20.200 --> 00:26.130
So going to create a new file and what I've done is I've created a folder called CSF sandbox to just

00:26.130 --> 00:31.950
because the CSF sandbox that we've we've been working with is really filling up so I just figured I'd

00:31.950 --> 00:33.960
start a new one for this section.

00:33.960 --> 00:41.550
So let's create a file called 1 underscore and we'll call this targeted let's say targeted underscore

00:42.210 --> 00:50.370
selectors dot HDMI out and we're going to just put in our boilerplate here and let's change the title.

00:51.030 --> 00:51.780
Targeted

00:54.210 --> 00:59.150
selectors and we'll go ahead and put our style tags in.

00:59.220 --> 01:04.560
Now the HDMI out for this is going to be really weird but I'm doing it for a reason because I want to

01:04.560 --> 01:07.460
show you how to select certain parts of it.

01:07.500 --> 01:15.270
So we're going to create a div and in this div we'll have a paragraph with we'll just do Lorem something

01:15.270 --> 01:22.920
really short to swarm five and then under that I'm going to put a U L and let's do list item for the

01:22.920 --> 01:29.550
content we'll say item in an increment and number so Dollar Sign and let's do three or two times three

01:30.030 --> 01:31.050
and enter.

01:31.110 --> 01:31.410
All right.

01:31.410 --> 01:37.010
And then under the U L we're going to put another paragraph with alarm 5.

01:37.050 --> 01:44.190
I also want to make this item too I want to wrap that in a paragraph tag as well and you'll see why

01:44.190 --> 01:46.010
I'm doing this in a few minutes.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.240
So we're going to do that and then we're going to put one more paragraph under the div.

01:51.270 --> 01:51.570
OK.

01:51.590 --> 01:54.990
So outside of the div OK.

01:55.020 --> 02:02.780
So up in the style here if we do div P like this you guys you know what this is going to do it's going

02:02.780 --> 02:06.210
to look for any paragraph that's inside of a div.

02:06.210 --> 02:06.650
Right.

02:06.660 --> 02:15.390
So I'm just gonna put a background of let's do grey let's save it let's open this up with live server

02:15.510 --> 02:19.950
and I'm actually going to just make this a little bigger so you guys can see it better.

02:20.040 --> 02:27.450
So what's going on here is every paragraph within a div is has the grey background if we look at the

02:27.450 --> 02:33.150
markup here this paragraph is in the div this paragraph is in the div this one is in the div this last

02:33.150 --> 02:33.870
one is not.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.890
So that doesn't pertain to this selector.

02:36.890 --> 02:45.330
Now what if we wanted to select a paragraph that was directly in a div it was a direct child of the

02:45.330 --> 02:45.790
div.

02:45.810 --> 02:52.740
So to do that we just put a comment here we'll say direct child to do that what we could do is just

02:52.800 --> 02:59.340
add a greater than sine angle bracket here and this is this is saying that we only want a paragraph

02:59.340 --> 03:02.040
that is a direct child of a div.

03:02.040 --> 03:08.190
So let's save that and you can see that the middle one here this disappeared because it no longer pertains

03:08.190 --> 03:10.080
to that because this item.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.900
I'm sorry this paragraph it's direct parent is a list item.

03:15.450 --> 03:16.140
OK.

03:16.260 --> 03:22.860
I mean to do that it's a list item even though it is in this div it's not the direct parent K the direct

03:22.860 --> 03:28.100
parent is a list item then that parent is the well and then that parent is div.

03:28.410 --> 03:35.340
So at the same time we can also select something that is directly after an element.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.270
So something that's on the same level.

03:37.380 --> 03:45.030
So let's say directly after and I'm going to say div and I'm going to use a plus sign here and then

03:45.030 --> 03:55.620
a P and let's change the background to we'll just do da s we'll do dark grey and then we'll do color

03:56.380 --> 03:57.060
white.

03:57.060 --> 03:59.750
So let's save that and see what happens.

03:59.760 --> 04:05.490
So the last paragraph is affected by this selector right here and the reason for that is we're saying

04:05.490 --> 04:11.760
we want a paragraph where the element right before it is a div.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.210
OK.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.540
Now you might be saying what about this one there's a div here.

04:15.540 --> 04:21.420
This is a child of the div K. So this paragraph is inside the div which makes it a child.

04:21.480 --> 04:25.950
This one is a sibling of this div they're on the same level.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.490
This is not inside of it.

04:27.660 --> 04:32.040
So that's what this pertains to is basically a sibling.

04:32.040 --> 04:32.390
OK.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.660
So the next sibling.

04:34.500 --> 04:34.900
All right.

04:35.820 --> 04:42.140
Now the next thing I want to show you is how we can add attributes as selectors.

04:42.150 --> 04:46.190
So I'm actually going to add some more markup down here under the paragraph I'm going to put a couple

04:46.200 --> 04:47.400
links.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.040
So this this will just go nowhere.

04:50.040 --> 04:55.960
I'm just gonna say page one we'll just pretend it's a link to another page on the site.

04:56.520 --> 05:02.590
So page two and then let's do another link for this one let's have a go to Google

05:05.260 --> 05:07.920
and for the text will say Google.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.200
All right.

05:08.200 --> 05:13.630
Now usually when you have an external link you're gonna have a target attribute and set it to underscore

05:13.660 --> 05:20.740
blank and that will take it off the you know it won't redirect you within the same tab it'll open up

05:20.740 --> 05:21.870
another tab.

05:22.150 --> 05:27.820
And if we wanted to style this based on it having a target attribute we could do that.

05:27.850 --> 05:39.040
So let's go up here and let's say by attribute so I could say the I want all the tags that have an attribute

05:39.100 --> 05:51.490
of target and then I want to add a background of let's do red the color white.

05:51.700 --> 05:57.790
OK so if I save that notice said the google link now has a red background and that's because it has

05:57.790 --> 05:59.020
a target on it.

05:59.020 --> 06:06.790
Now if I were to add a target to this one here let's say target this time let's set it to underscore

06:06.790 --> 06:12.010
self will save and it gets a red background because it does have the target.

06:12.010 --> 06:18.430
Now in addition to this you can also you can reference the actual value.

06:18.460 --> 06:26.010
So if we want to say where the target is equal to underscore blank and say you'll see that now go it

06:26.020 --> 06:32.320
Google is the only one that has the red background because we're saying the target has to be blank where

06:32.320 --> 06:34.030
this one is actually self.

06:34.470 --> 06:34.740
OK.

06:34.740 --> 06:39.430
And I'm going to give you a more practical example of this so I'm just going to put that back like that

06:39.880 --> 06:50.770
and then let's go down here and let's say a specific attribute values and where I use this the most

06:50.770 --> 06:57.820
is with forms so or form inputs I should say so I want to just add some line breaks here and let's add

06:57.820 --> 06:58.630
a form

07:01.350 --> 07:04.380
and we're just going to have a couple inputs.

07:04.380 --> 07:14.130
So let's say input with the type of text and we don't need a name or idea we'll put a place holder and

07:14.130 --> 07:19.560
just say name and then I'll copy this down two more times this one will be an email I'm also going to

07:19.560 --> 07:23.940
change the type to email which is similar to a text field.

07:23.940 --> 07:28.010
This one is actually going to be a submits I want this to be a button to submit.

07:28.080 --> 07:34.290
So it's not going have a place holder however it needs a value because that's the text that is displayed.

07:34.310 --> 07:34.620
All right.

07:34.650 --> 07:38.380
So we'll save that and we get this right here.

07:38.430 --> 07:47.370
So let's say I want the name in the email input to go to be 100 percent with and add a little bit of

07:47.370 --> 07:47.930
margin.

07:47.940 --> 08:00.930
So if I were to just do input and say with 100 percent and then say margin bottom we'll do like 0 5

08:01.000 --> 08:01.910
pixels.

08:02.170 --> 08:05.290
And if we were to save that you'll see that all of these.

08:05.320 --> 08:08.650
This is gonna pertain to all of them because they're all inputs.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.590
They have different types but they're all inputs.

08:10.600 --> 08:17.680
So we may want to target certain types and in this case I want the name field in the email to have the

08:17.680 --> 08:20.340
hundred percent but not the button itself.

08:20.350 --> 08:28.000
So what I would do and this is something that I is pretty common for me is I would say input where the

08:28.000 --> 08:30.710
type equals text.

08:30.850 --> 08:38.050
If I do that only the name extends because it has a type of text but then we could put a comma we could

08:38.050 --> 08:45.430
say input where the type where the type equals email and save.

08:45.430 --> 08:51.190
And now both the name in the email are 100 percent and a lot of cases if it's like a contact form you'd

08:51.190 --> 08:55.510
also do the you know the text area as well but yeah.

08:55.540 --> 09:00.400
So that's how we can target specific values of attributes.

09:00.430 --> 09:00.760
OK.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.590
And it doesn't have to be input with the type.

09:02.590 --> 09:06.220
It can be any attribute at all.

09:06.220 --> 09:07.090
Why did that.

09:08.560 --> 09:13.360
Why did that change what did I do wrong here.

09:13.390 --> 09:13.850
There you go.

09:13.940 --> 09:14.750
All right.

09:14.840 --> 09:23.390
So I mean these are just some some other other methods to to target certain things in the DOM to style.

09:23.510 --> 09:29.150
You're not going to be using these as much obviously but you may run into a situation where they could

09:29.150 --> 09:29.780
help you out.

09:30.530 --> 09:30.790
All right.

09:30.800 --> 09:37.130
So in the next video we're going to talk about a special pseudo selector or a pseudo class called End

09:37.190 --> 09:37.820
Child.
