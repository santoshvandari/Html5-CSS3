WEBVTT

00:00.580 --> 00:05.010
All right guys so in this video we're going to start to work on the articles down below.

00:05.010 --> 00:10.850
Basically our grid of articles and this quite a bit of each team l here quite a bit of mark up.

00:10.890 --> 00:14.360
I'm actually going to just make this a little bigger so that you guys can read it better.

00:14.880 --> 00:21.210
So under the header let's say Home Articles and we're gonna give.

00:21.210 --> 00:27.690
This is gonna be a section so going to use the H HTML5 section tag and we're gonna give an an idea of

00:27.690 --> 00:36.360
home dash articles and we're also gonna create padding classes so I'm gonna give it a class of P Y dash

00:36.360 --> 00:42.200
to just to give it some padding on the top and bottom and the way that these are gonna be set up is

00:42.300 --> 00:43.610
they're gonna be a little different.

00:43.620 --> 00:48.720
So for instance this first one we're actually going to make this a grid within a grid so that we can

00:48.720 --> 00:54.600
align it this way and then some of these will be adding a background color to some of them will have

00:54.600 --> 00:55.650
an image on the top.

00:55.650 --> 01:00.440
Some on the bottom so they'll be formatted a little bit differently.

01:00.690 --> 01:01.930
So let's go.

01:01.950 --> 01:08.330
Let's create the first one which is this one here which again is gonna be a grid within a grid.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.130
So actually let's put our heading for us.

01:11.130 --> 01:21.180
We're going to say Editor's Picks or editor picks and then what I want to do is create a container for

01:21.180 --> 01:21.720
our grid.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.950
So we're gonna call this one.

01:23.970 --> 01:31.000
Let's call it articles or articles excuse me articles container.

01:32.010 --> 01:37.330
And then each one is gonna be an article tag and I'm gonna give it a class of card.

01:37.440 --> 01:45.300
So card is something you see often in frameworks like bootstrap where you have maybe a background like

01:45.300 --> 01:51.210
this and some padding just something to put your content into rather than just having the text and images

01:51.210 --> 01:55.320
just you know just just floating there with just the background.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.970
Sometimes you'll have a like a colored heading like maybe a background with a heading something like

01:59.970 --> 02:01.080
that but yeah.

02:01.080 --> 02:01.500
That's going to.

02:01.490 --> 02:06.480
Those are gonna be cards so each one of these articles will have a class of card and we're going to

02:06.480 --> 02:13.530
put our first image in which is going to be in I am G slash articles and it's gonna be E.A. one.

02:13.530 --> 02:23.430
So this is an entertainment article and this this right here this is going to ax.

02:23.430 --> 02:29.430
This is gonna be a grid container and then this will be if one grid item in them will have a div that

02:29.430 --> 02:32.430
will have the rest of the stuff inside of it.

02:32.460 --> 02:43.600
So for instance the category which is going to be have a class of category dash he and t say entertainment.

02:43.800 --> 02:52.110
And underneath that we're gonna have our H 3 R title which is gonna be a link and it's gonna go to Article

02:52.110 --> 03:01.230
dot HDMI all we'll just say launch five for the article for the title rather and then under the h three

03:01.230 --> 03:10.680
we're going to put a paragraph and we'll say Lorem 20 thing is a 20 looks like 20 so that's gonna be

03:10.680 --> 03:17.040
our first one and if I save it and we take a look it's the image is gonna be giant because the images

03:17.040 --> 03:21.270
have have a width of one hundred percent.

03:21.270 --> 03:26.430
Now one thing I forgot is the main container you see how this is up against the edge like this because

03:26.430 --> 03:32.010
we didn't add the container class so right under the section I'm going to have a class of container

03:32.330 --> 03:39.480
that's going to wrap around everything so we just want to take all this and cut that out and put that

03:39.480 --> 03:42.000
inside the container and save.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.880
And now you can see that there's some padding on the edge here and it also line it to the middle.

03:47.740 --> 03:48.010
OK.

03:48.050 --> 03:52.560
So let's add our next article I'm just going to copy this.

03:53.010 --> 03:56.640
Now this one is not going to be its own grid.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.630
So we're talking about this right here.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.930
So we don't need to have this extra div.

04:04.740 --> 04:12.180
So we're gonna take that out widget and we're not even going to have an image we can take that out and

04:12.540 --> 04:13.380
that should be good.

04:13.380 --> 04:17.590
Let's move this back a little bit in the category is sports.

04:17.590 --> 04:27.450
So we're gonna change this to sports and change this to sports and we'll leave the title in the paragraph.

04:27.450 --> 04:27.770
All right.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.620
So if we take a look we should have something like this.

04:31.620 --> 04:37.740
The next one is gonna be similar to what we just did only it's gonna have an image up top.

04:37.740 --> 04:48.820
So let's copy the one we just did and paste that in and just fix this.

04:48.850 --> 04:54.960
So this one is gonna have an image right above the categories so let's say image and it's gonna be I

04:54.960 --> 04:56.230
am G slash

04:58.360 --> 05:07.000
articles slash and it's what is it technology so we want tech one dot j peg and we'll change this to

05:07.000 --> 05:12.100
tech and this to technology.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.570
OK we'll save that.

05:13.570 --> 05:17.520
Make sure the image shows up and then we have the content under it.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.080
So the next one is similar except the image is at the bottom.

05:21.160 --> 05:31.360
So I'll just copy what we just did and Let's paste that in and we're just going to take the image is

05:31.360 --> 05:34.240
actually going to be let's see what is this sports.

05:34.240 --> 05:43.570
So this is gonna be sports one dot j peg but we're gonna move this to the bottom of the article so right

05:43.570 --> 05:50.300
under the paragraph and we'll change the category change.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.470
This right here.

05:53.470 --> 05:53.830
Good.

05:54.520 --> 06:01.360
And then the next one is this one here which is basically the same thing is this just different image.

06:01.360 --> 06:08.110
So we'll go ahead and copy that one with the tech one image and paste that annual changes to tech to

06:12.060 --> 06:12.820
k.

06:12.840 --> 06:18.420
Next one is gonna be this which doesn't have an image or anything like that so I'll copy the one that

06:18.420 --> 06:22.560
we did with no image which is the second one.

06:22.560 --> 06:28.530
So this is the first one this is the second one and we'll put that right here

06:32.640 --> 06:35.030
OK but this is gonna be it is sports.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.030
So we can actually leave that.

06:37.200 --> 06:43.750
And then this last one is similar to the first one in that it's gonna be a grid within a grid.

06:43.830 --> 06:49.050
So let's let's copy the first one

06:52.280 --> 06:57.990
I know this is a lot of markup and hopefully it's not too confusing if you want you can just get the

06:58.020 --> 07:03.930
finished files from the first lecture of this section and you can just copy this whole thing.

07:03.930 --> 07:10.200
I sure probably should have said that before but yeah this is gonna be E.A. to only I want to take the

07:10.200 --> 07:13.300
image and put it after the div.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.430
So put the image right here.

07:16.620 --> 07:16.920
All right.

07:16.950 --> 07:17.960
So we'll save that.

07:17.970 --> 07:23.250
And if we take a look it's going to look pretty bad it's just all you know all in one line because we

07:23.250 --> 07:25.480
haven't added the grid yet.

07:25.860 --> 07:33.600
So let's jump into style CSX and let's start to add our grid actually first thing I'm going to do is

07:33.600 --> 07:44.820
add the utility classes like the card class so see we'll go right below the buttons and say.

07:44.820 --> 07:55.380
Card is going gonna give this a background of whites and let's do a padding of one room.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.550
So we save that.

07:56.550 --> 08:02.780
Now you can see that each one of these articles they're all wrapped in the in the white container are

08:02.790 --> 08:03.830
white card.

08:04.800 --> 08:11.550
So I think yeah we'll just we'll do leave that for now and then we'll go back down and let us style

08:11.580 --> 08:14.370
our Home Articles.

08:14.640 --> 08:14.920
OK.

08:14.950 --> 08:22.800
So we have an I.D. of home dash articles and remember we have a class in there called articles dash

08:23.640 --> 08:26.690
container and that's what we want to set the grid on.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.210
That's going to be the grid parent.

08:29.180 --> 08:29.580
OK.

08:29.580 --> 08:36.720
And then as far as the template columns we're gonna say grid template columns and we're gonna set repeat

08:37.220 --> 08:40.800
and we want 3 1 F.

08:41.040 --> 08:45.510
So if I save that automatically they're going to set to three in a row.

08:45.510 --> 08:52.230
Now I want some spacing in between so let's add a grid gap of one room.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.130
Whoops.

08:53.160 --> 08:53.400
Yeah.

08:53.400 --> 08:53.910
There we go.

08:54.450 --> 08:54.780
OK.

08:54.810 --> 09:02.850
So now we have some spacing and I mean that's that's not too bad itself but what I do want to do is

09:03.180 --> 09:08.720
like I said turn this one into its own grid and then span it over one.

09:08.790 --> 09:09.270
OK.

09:09.330 --> 09:18.480
Just to just to give it a little a little bit of style so we can grab on to this without giving it a

09:18.480 --> 09:21.250
special class by using first child.

09:21.270 --> 09:21.540
OK.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.470
Same with the last.

09:22.470 --> 09:24.370
We want this to do the same thing.

09:24.390 --> 09:30.960
So what I'll do is I'll go down and say home dash articles

09:33.510 --> 09:34.950
Articles.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.370
Dash.

09:36.630 --> 09:38.160
Container.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.710
Now I want the first article right.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.770
So I could say article first.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.970
Dash child I could do that.

09:47.970 --> 09:48.600
But what if I.

09:48.660 --> 09:51.900
What if I wanted to change it to a div or something I think I want to.

09:51.920 --> 09:57.990
I'm going to make this a little more flexible and I'm gonna use an asterisk here meaning any any element

09:58.130 --> 10:06.360
it doesn't have to be an article but I only want D the direct child so I'm gonna use the the greater

10:06.360 --> 10:07.370
than OK.

10:07.560 --> 10:14.310
So we're just saying any anything whatever this is even if even if this was changed to a div we're still

10:14.310 --> 10:18.640
going to target this first element here and only this first one.

10:18.690 --> 10:20.550
So let's add.

10:20.730 --> 10:32.090
Display grid to this and we're gonna add grid dash template columns and we just want to repeat.

10:32.880 --> 10:40.320
We want to repeat to 1 F far so we want basically the image is gonna be in one half hour and then the

10:40.320 --> 10:49.260
text the div with the text will be in one half hour and let's just add a grid dash gap and let's say

10:51.240 --> 10:55.690
1 REM and save that.

10:55.690 --> 10:56.030
All right.

10:56.040 --> 11:04.710
So what we've done here is we've turned this item the first child into a grid and we've set it to repeat

11:04.710 --> 11:06.810
to 1 FDR with some grid gap.

11:06.810 --> 11:09.270
Now obviously this doesn't look very good.

11:09.270 --> 11:12.230
What we need to do is span this across.

11:12.240 --> 11:21.510
K We wanted to take up two columns so what I can do is let's see here we'll just put it right in here

11:21.510 --> 11:32.670
so we'll say grid dash column from one we want to span it to a cross so we'll save.

11:32.670 --> 11:33.420
And then we go.

11:33.420 --> 11:34.660
It spans across.

11:34.770 --> 11:37.080
Now the images is kind of up too far.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.750
I want to basically center it.

11:38.760 --> 11:47.600
So I'm going to add a line dash items to the center.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.510
We'll save that.

11:48.510 --> 11:50.170
Now the images in the center.

11:51.030 --> 11:51.350
OK.

11:51.380 --> 11:54.860
So I want to do basically the same thing to the last.

11:54.900 --> 12:03.630
So I'm going to copy this whole thing right here and just put a comma paste that in and change this

12:03.630 --> 12:08.310
to last child so that we can target that and save.

12:08.310 --> 12:12.970
And now you can see we get the same thing now.

12:13.710 --> 12:20.650
Actually you know what we need to right now we're saying start at 1 and span 2.

12:20.650 --> 12:25.730
And that's not what we want because we wanted to start here so we actually wanted to start at two and

12:25.730 --> 12:26.940
span two.

12:26.980 --> 12:39.950
So we're gonna have to also just grab this go down here and take this and say we want to start it too

12:39.980 --> 12:41.020
in span too.

12:41.050 --> 12:42.280
So we'll go ahead and save that.

12:42.280 --> 12:42.880
And there he goes.

12:42.910 --> 12:46.060
Now it's put in this place all right.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.340
So that looks pretty good.

12:48.340 --> 12:53.190
Last thing we want to add our background classes and our padding classes.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.210
So this should have background dark.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.510
This should have background primary.

12:57.730 --> 13:04.600
And we also need that the pattern classes because this right here is just too close to to the showcase.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.140
Remember we added the P Y to class.

13:07.240 --> 13:16.780
So let's go on top and we're going to add in all the background classes which we're gonna have three.

13:16.780 --> 13:28.630
So let's say big dash dark and we're gonna do a background we'll use our our dark color variable and

13:28.630 --> 13:32.940
let's do a color white.

13:32.950 --> 13:33.350
All right.

13:33.370 --> 13:39.910
And let's go ahead and just go and copy this down twice.

13:39.970 --> 13:51.970
Let's change this to primary and change this to secondary OK and then we'll add our pattern classes.

13:51.970 --> 14:05.140
So I'm gonna do P Why do class P Y dash one and 4 padding for this I'm going to do one point five.

14:05.380 --> 14:07.060
Yeah one point five REM.

14:07.060 --> 14:08.950
Top and bottom.

14:08.950 --> 14:10.930
Copy this down a couple times.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.070
This one will be two.

14:13.630 --> 14:22.660
And then this one will be three and we'll change these to two and three and then I'm going to copy this

14:23.470 --> 14:29.650
and we want we also want pattern classes for all around which will be p1 p2 and P3 and then we'll just

14:29.650 --> 14:33.250
take the 0 away which will make it padding all the way around.

14:34.780 --> 14:37.150
OK so those are padding classes.

14:37.150 --> 14:38.760
Let's save that.

14:38.920 --> 14:43.440
Now we haven't added the big color yet you can see the padding is now there.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.790
But let's add our big color classes or BGP backgrounds.

14:49.660 --> 14:56.340
So let's see we have the first one which is right here the second one I'm going to give a class of BJP

14:56.350 --> 15:09.190
dash dark save it and c that didn't work why didn't network Class B G.

15:09.200 --> 15:09.860
Dark

15:18.790 --> 15:19.780
because of the card

15:24.130 --> 15:26.400
dark color background.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.480
P.G. dark

15:32.130 --> 15:33.790
article class P.G. dark.

15:33.810 --> 15:36.720
I'm not sure why that's why I put it.

15:36.870 --> 15:37.830
I put on this one.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.360
That's the wrong one.

15:39.360 --> 15:43.530
It's gonna be right here.

15:43.530 --> 15:44.130
There we go.

15:45.030 --> 15:45.400
OK.

15:45.420 --> 15:49.170
So we have an issue here the heading is not white.

15:49.170 --> 15:56.100
Even though we put color white we have to specifically target the heading or if there's any links.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.050
We also want to set those to white.

15:58.050 --> 16:07.050
So actually what I'm going to do is just create a bunch of styles here we'll do big dark each one

16:09.570 --> 16:10.410
BFG.

16:10.430 --> 16:11.870
Dark.

16:11.880 --> 16:16.480
Sorry about the length of this video guys we're just doing quite a bit here.

16:16.770 --> 16:19.990
That should be primary.

16:20.200 --> 16:20.470
Nope.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.230
Fiji dark.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.170
We're doing H.

16:22.250 --> 16:26.040
Let's just do H1 H2 and H3.

16:27.080 --> 16:33.200
And I know we only have an 3 but we might use BFG dark somewhere where there's an H1 or an H two as

16:33.200 --> 16:39.650
well so I I'm just trying to make this scalable basically and then let's take care of any links.

16:39.680 --> 16:50.310
So BGP dark a and then let's take care of the primary and secondary background so paste this in let's

16:50.320 --> 16:55.030
do primary paste that in

16:57.860 --> 17:05.110
secondary by the way I'm using controlled D to select the next one down and then we'll just set that

17:05.110 --> 17:10.250
to color white and save.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.120
And now you can see that this the heading is white.

17:13.120 --> 17:17.590
So I want this one right here to have the BJP primary so let's go back.

17:17.650 --> 17:18.310
So it's the set.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.060
It's the second to last one.

17:22.240 --> 17:30.740
So this is the last article let's go to the second to last and say BJP dash primary and save there go

17:31.930 --> 17:33.910
so that looks pretty good.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.020
And obviously it's not responsive yet.

17:36.040 --> 17:41.570
Well we're going to get to that probably last but I think that looks decent.

17:41.680 --> 17:46.510
So in the next video what I want to do is take care of the footer which we're also gonna use the grid

17:46.510 --> 17:49.430
in we're basically gonna have five items.

17:49.480 --> 17:54.260
So one two three four and then the fifth one we're gonna span all the way across like that.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.160
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
