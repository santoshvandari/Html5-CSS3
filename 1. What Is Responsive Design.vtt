All right so up to this point we've looked at most of each team all five and the basics of CSX.

00:05.190 --> 00:11.370
We created a little hotel Web site and it does use some elements of responsive design but it still isn't

00:11.370 --> 00:15.560
responsive because we have yet to add media queries where they're needed.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.950
If you go and you take the hotel website and you make your browser really small it's going to look like

00:19.950 --> 00:20.430
crap.

00:20.460 --> 00:23.310
But we're gonna fix that by the end of this section.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.470
So I just want to quickly go over what responsiveness is and how we can achieve it.

00:27.570 --> 00:35.520
Then we'll jump in we'll look at media queries and some other stuff such as relative CSX units so responsive

00:35.520 --> 00:41.670
design is when we use each team Alan assess to make a web site or an application layout respond to different

00:41.670 --> 00:49.230
screen sizes and a few years ago making a web site or layout responsive was kind of a luxury I can actually

00:49.230 --> 00:55.170
remember asking clients if they wanted to pay extra to make their Web site responsive.

00:55.170 --> 00:57.140
But now it's really a necessity.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.240
It's not an add on or a luxury.

00:59.280 --> 01:05.310
And the reason for that is the huge increase of the use of smartphones and tablets and other devices.

01:05.310 --> 01:07.380
A lot of people now don't even have computers.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.230
They're fine with either a tablet or even their smartphone.

01:11.010 --> 01:14.990
So let's look at some of the different ways to achieve responsive design.

01:15.420 --> 01:21.150
So the viewport tag is important because it tells the browser how to handle the pages and dimensions

01:21.150 --> 01:22.560
and scaling.

01:22.560 --> 01:29.190
We've already set this in our pages and it's actually default with Emmett with our boiler plate generation

01:29.460 --> 01:35.370
in V.S. code using fluid widths is also something we've done remember our containers we use max width

01:35.370 --> 01:41.940
instead instead of just width allows the text to adapt to smaller screen sizes.

01:41.940 --> 01:47.580
Now the most significant part of Responsive Web Design and probably the most difficult are media queries

01:47.610 --> 01:54.180
not setting them but learning how to use them and when to use them and media queries allow us to specify

01:54.180 --> 01:57.500
certain CSF styles based on the screen size.

01:57.510 --> 02:04.080
So for example if we wanted to float some elements if the screen was bigger than six hundred pixels

02:04.290 --> 02:11.250
we could write a media query for that if we wanted a font size to be smaller on just mobile devices

02:11.430 --> 02:14.760
that were 500 pixels or less we could do that as well.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.790
All right so we're going to we're going to do that.

02:16.820 --> 02:21.740
And we're also going to update our hotel project to use media queries.

02:21.780 --> 02:27.800
Another good idea is to use REM units over pixels it keeps sizes intact with the rest of the page because

02:27.800 --> 02:34.480
a rem unit is a multiplier of whatever the root H HTML elements font size is case and we're going to

02:34.530 --> 02:40.250
we're going to go over that in this section we're also going to talk about VH and VW units.

02:40.440 --> 02:46.450
So we also have a design method or strategy called mobile first which is pretty popular these days.

02:46.530 --> 02:52.590
This is where you first design the layout for mobile devices meaning small screens and then you add

02:52.590 --> 02:59.500
your media queries for the larger screen styles and you might even display less content on mobile devices.

02:59.500 --> 03:04.590
You know your most important content and then have more and larger devices when you have more real estate.

03:05.270 --> 03:09.780
And we're actually going to do a mobile first project later on all right.

03:09.810 --> 03:14.700
So in the next video I want to start to look at media queries in their syntax.

03:14.880 --> 03:21.210
Then we'll talk a little bit about relative units like RAM and M and finally will update our hotel project

03:21.210 --> 03:22.530
to be responsive.
