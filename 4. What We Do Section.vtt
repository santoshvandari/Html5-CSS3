WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:04.080
All right so in the last video we did the header or the showcase area.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.550
So now we're going to move on to the.

00:05.580 --> 00:10.170
What we do section so we're gonna go in the H2 all file directly under the header.

00:10.170 --> 00:16.740
Let's put a comment here or we'll just say section and let's say what we do and we're gonna use in a

00:16.740 --> 00:21.260
show five section tag and we're gonna give this an idea of what.

00:21.690 --> 00:28.520
Now if we look at the final version here we go down to the what we do you can see that there's it's

00:28.560 --> 00:33.610
a light gray background also there's some padding on the top and bottom.

00:33.660 --> 00:42.930
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna add a class here of BMG dash light and then I'm gonna do a class

00:42.930 --> 00:50.040
of P Y dash one K so remember I think we did this in the hotel website where we had the padding classes

00:50.040 --> 00:52.580
so Pete the Y is the y axis.

00:52.590 --> 01:00.330
Basically we want padding on top and bottom and we'll have p y one two and three and b g lt will be

01:00.330 --> 01:02.360
the the light gray background.

01:02.570 --> 01:03.000
OK.

01:03.010 --> 01:09.840
Now we want to also have a container in here because we want the content to stay in the middle we don't

01:09.840 --> 01:17.940
want it to go all the way over and then we're going to have an H to K and this H two is going to have

01:17.940 --> 01:24.720
a class and I don't want it to be as large as the showcase heading which has a class of L headings so

01:24.720 --> 01:33.750
let's do a m heading for medium so medium heading and then we're gonna have the text primary around

01:33.750 --> 01:35.000
the word What.

01:35.010 --> 01:42.910
K so we're gonna put a span in here with the class of text primary and we're going to say what.

01:42.930 --> 01:49.160
And then after the span put a space and say we do OK.

01:49.170 --> 01:54.960
And then under the H two is where we're going to put our boxes and we're going to just give this a class

01:54.960 --> 02:01.710
of items which is gonna be our Flex container and then inside our Flex container we're gonna have these

02:01.710 --> 02:07.850
three items as flex items so let's just give them a class of item.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.660
So we'll do item times three.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.940
So we have three items and each one is gonna have an icon.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.720
So it's two I class of font.

02:17.730 --> 02:18.300
Awesome.

02:18.300 --> 02:27.870
Also a class of F A Dash university is gonna be this first one here and I want to make it a little bigger

02:27.870 --> 02:39.070
so let's do f a two X that'll increase it increase the size and then I also want a div with the h three.

02:39.090 --> 02:43.530
This one will say investment banking

02:46.400 --> 02:51.930
and then under that let's do a paragraph with law we'll do Lord 10.

02:52.070 --> 02:52.520
OK.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.230
And then I'm just going to copy the I.

02:54.270 --> 03:03.390
The icon and the div and we want to do the same thing in both of these items except we want to change

03:03.390 --> 03:11.820
of course the icon we don't want all the same icons this one is gonna be F.A. book dash reader and then

03:11.820 --> 03:22.200
this last one is going to be FAA dash pencil dash opt in and let's just change the title so this next

03:22.200 --> 03:34.300
one let's do portfolio management and then tax and custodial.

03:34.350 --> 03:35.660
Okay now we'll save that.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.620
Let's take a look at ours.

03:38.070 --> 03:40.890
So it's going to look like this without any styling.

03:40.890 --> 03:51.660
So now let's hop over to style CSX and we don't have the container yet so maybe we should do that first.

03:51.780 --> 03:55.020
So let's see it's basically utility class.

03:55.040 --> 04:01.830
So we'll go right here we'll say container and remember containers that we want to restrict it to a

04:01.830 --> 04:03.180
certain width.

04:03.450 --> 04:11.640
We want to give it a max width which I'm going to do eleven hundred pixels and then let's do margin

04:11.670 --> 04:15.500
auto to make sure that it aligns in the middle.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.340
And then just a little padding.

04:17.940 --> 04:24.440
So I'll do zero top and bottom to ram left and right and let's do overflow hidden.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.180
OK.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.670
So save that and you can see we have some padding here and this is going to stay in the middle no matter

04:32.670 --> 04:41.580
what another class we added was the M heading class actually know what I think I wanted to yeah I will

04:41.580 --> 04:43.910
also want the the headings centred.

04:44.100 --> 04:53.460
So in addition to m heading let's also add a class of text center and we'll go to our style sheet and

04:53.490 --> 05:00.510
let's put text center and I just want that to align the text to the center.

05:00.510 --> 05:04.350
So that takes in text align center.

05:05.770 --> 05:10.690
OK so now that's moved to the center let's do the M heading.

05:11.070 --> 05:20.540
So we should put that right under the L heading I'm just going to copy this and font size for the M

05:20.540 --> 05:29.750
heading s change that is gonna be to REM and the margin bottom will leave that line height I guess we

05:29.760 --> 05:32.410
are we can leave that as well.

05:33.140 --> 05:35.370
So we'll save that.

05:35.630 --> 05:35.960
Good.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.080
So it's a little bigger.

05:37.280 --> 05:43.670
Now we also added that p y one because we need to have some padding here and at the bottom so we might

05:43.670 --> 05:49.490
as will add our padding classes now so I'll go to the bottom of the utility classes actually let's go

05:49.490 --> 05:50.510
right above the button.

05:50.530 --> 05:54.890
It doesn't really matter where you put this stuff but let's do P Y.

05:54.920 --> 06:02.290
Class P Y 1 so padding C padding.

06:02.300 --> 06:06.140
I'm going to do one point five Ram.

06:06.470 --> 06:08.600
Top and bottom.

06:08.600 --> 06:08.980
All right.

06:08.990 --> 06:15.440
And actually know what I'll do is since we only have one property here Let's shorten this up a little

06:15.440 --> 06:25.610
bit and then we'll copy this down and let's do two and three case we need to add more padding so to

06:25.610 --> 06:31.660
Let's do two RAM and then three we'll do three ram.

06:31.880 --> 06:36.740
So if we save that now you can see that we have some padding right here and if you want to make it bigger

06:36.740 --> 06:38.870
you could give it p y two if you want.

06:39.850 --> 06:40.170
OK.

06:40.190 --> 06:48.710
So I think that's good for the utility classes now let's work on the Flex items here and we're also

06:48.710 --> 06:51.320
gonna be styling the icon as well.

06:51.320 --> 06:58.250
But let's take the items so I'm going to go down below the showcase and let's just say

07:03.750 --> 07:05.570
section what we do.

07:06.900 --> 07:07.210
OK.

07:07.220 --> 07:15.160
So we have a class of items that wrap around all three and we want to display as a flex box.

07:15.190 --> 07:25.320
So once we save that it's going to align them in let's take a guy who just make this smaller so we can

07:25.320 --> 07:28.940
see both.

07:29.020 --> 07:33.230
Let's take each item.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.150
See what I want to do here.

07:35.150 --> 07:45.080
Yeah let's take each item in center center all the content so we'll say dot item and let's out of flex

07:45.090 --> 07:54.190
one and let's do text align center and save.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.110
Case looks pretty good.

07:56.210 --> 08:05.210
Let's also add padding to the item actually no one's going to do is add padding to the items itself

08:07.590 --> 08:16.390
so we'll do one room here and then let's also do padding on each item one room and save.

08:16.620 --> 08:20.440
So that kind of spreads it spreads stuff out a little bit.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.900
Now let's see for the icon here.

08:23.910 --> 08:26.480
I wanted to have that green circle around it.

08:26.490 --> 08:28.560
So let's let's target that.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.660
We'll go ahead and do.

08:32.160 --> 08:32.650
Actually no.

08:32.670 --> 08:37.790
Let's let's put the idea of what here.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.290
So what.

08:39.300 --> 08:43.620
And then items and then item we're just better targeting it.

08:44.880 --> 08:50.220
And then here I'm going to say what items item.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.410
And then we want to target the icon.

08:52.800 --> 09:00.520
And we're gonna have a background of our grass green color which is going to be hexadecimal 9 3 C B

09:00.780 --> 09:08.130
5 2 gives it that green and then to make it basically a circle.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.720
Because if I save that it's going to hate how it just goes back up.

09:11.730 --> 09:15.410
But unfortunately we just have to keep scrolling back down.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.190
But you can see we have the green background.

09:17.610 --> 09:20.190
So let's add some padding.

09:20.700 --> 09:29.900
So we'll do one round of padding and to make it circle we want to do a border radius of 50 percent.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.330
OK that'll give it that circle.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.260
So if I saved that then we go.

09:34.260 --> 09:38.330
We just want to add a little margin to the bottom to push the heading down.

09:38.640 --> 09:44.100
So we'll say margin bottom one room.

09:44.190 --> 09:45.900
Here we go.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.670
Now as this gets bigger the reason I'm using.

09:48.670 --> 09:51.050
No we have the widescreen CSX.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.130
Well that's not right.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.030
Okay so something.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.000
What did what did we miss here.

09:57.030 --> 10:01.560
So let's actually go back to the section content because that's where this overlay is.

10:02.100 --> 10:06.160
And I think it's because we have it.

10:06.180 --> 10:10.980
We have position absolute we have top comes down 60 left 0.

10:10.980 --> 10:19.530
We should also add right zero because this is positioned absolute so we'll do right zero and bottom

10:19.530 --> 10:21.670
zero.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.040
So we wanted to start right on the edge.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.200
I'll save that.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.350
And now it brings it back to the edge.

10:27.360 --> 10:36.360
So no matter how big or small this is you can see the overlay still covers it and it should still still

10:36.360 --> 10:37.830
reach the bottom no matter what.

10:38.370 --> 10:38.640
All right.

10:38.670 --> 10:39.660
So sorry about that.

10:39.660 --> 10:42.290
That little mistake there guys.

10:42.510 --> 10:50.370
But anyways yeah when we have a wide screen I actually want the icons to go on the side here but I'm

10:50.370 --> 10:55.740
not going to get into that until we get into the responsiveness we add that we actually start adding

10:56.010 --> 11:01.100
styles to the mobile and the widescreen dot see ISIS file.

11:01.230 --> 11:05.530
So I think that we're good for now and the next section or in the next video where either we're going

11:05.530 --> 11:11.490
to start to work on the WHO WE ARE section which if we look at this it's just basically going to be

11:11.490 --> 11:17.760
an image over here and then some text over here with a list or style it a little bit maybe we can get

11:17.760 --> 11:20.610
the clients in in the next video as well.

11:20.610 --> 11:20.840
All right.

11:20.850 --> 11:21.600
So I'll see you then.
