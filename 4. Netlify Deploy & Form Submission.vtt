WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:03.330
All right guys so we have the news grid files.

00:03.330 --> 00:06.210
We have them in a repository on GitHub dot com.

00:06.210 --> 00:12.690
So now we can deploy it in that lo fi in literally seconds or minutes in in our case because I'm going

00:12.690 --> 00:17.730
to be explaining some things but you'll see how simple it is if we go to our panel here and that lo

00:17.730 --> 00:22.860
fi panel which is very simple we could just say new site from get.

00:23.160 --> 00:28.980
And we have different providers here we used GitHub so we're gonna click on github and you might get

00:29.010 --> 00:36.690
a little box set that asks you to vote to authorize your GitHub account so that nettled Fi can access

00:36.690 --> 00:41.490
your repositories and then you're going to see all your repositories down here and you can see I have

00:41.490 --> 00:42.670
quite a few.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.820
So I'm going to search for news grid

00:49.520 --> 00:55.160
and if if you just created a get hub account and did and follow the instructions you'll just have this

00:55.160 --> 00:56.390
one repository.

00:56.390 --> 01:01.330
So we're gonna choose that we're gonna choose the master branch it's the only branch we have.

01:01.660 --> 01:05.760
And then we don't need a build command or published directory because everything is in the root.

01:05.780 --> 01:11.470
So we're gonna just say deploy site and you can see this little gears spinning should only take a couple

01:11.480 --> 01:12.010
seconds.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.950
And now our site is deployed.

01:13.950 --> 01:14.240
OK.

01:14.300 --> 01:18.080
So it's as easy as that to actually get your Web site live on the Internet.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.880
Now the domain as you can see right here is something.

01:20.990 --> 01:24.120
It's gonna be different than this but it's going to be something crazy.

01:24.170 --> 01:30.380
Mine is optimistic fe fe in men and then some numbers dot net lo fi dot com.

01:30.380 --> 01:35.690
So let's go ahead and open this up in a new tab and there's our Web site.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.470
So deployment is that easy with nullify.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.460
Now the domain we're gonna take care of that.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.230
Don't worry about it.

01:41.990 --> 01:45.460
But what I want to do is I want to make this form work.

01:45.590 --> 01:53.150
OK so I'm going to search for Natalya Phi forms and this is documentation page here.

01:53.150 --> 01:58.850
We'll show us what we have to do we have to add method post to our form tag and data nullify equals

01:58.850 --> 01:59.530
true.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.180
And then just make sure we have a name attribute on on each field which we only have an email field.

02:05.180 --> 02:11.990
Now we've already deployed our our pushed our repository to github and deployed our Web site.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.590
But we need to make a change.

02:13.620 --> 02:13.890
OK.

02:13.910 --> 02:20.180
So whenever you need to make a change you need to push your need to update your repository and push

02:20.180 --> 02:20.930
to get hub.

02:21.050 --> 02:24.770
And then it should automatically update on the site.

02:24.770 --> 02:32.900
So let's do that let's go to C and it's going to minimize this and I'm going to open up our news grid

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Web site in V.S. code

02:38.900 --> 02:41.120
and make that bigger.

02:41.690 --> 02:47.420
And we just closed this stuff up so let's see we have our news good Web site open and the form is on

02:47.450 --> 02:48.140
every page.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.890
So we're just going to have to go to each of the three each him all pages.

02:51.890 --> 03:06.200
Let's go down to our form and let's add a method of post and we just say data dash network Phi equals

03:07.330 --> 03:08.720
true.

03:09.160 --> 03:15.980
And then the input of this email input we want to give a name of IMAP.

03:16.010 --> 03:18.700
All right let me just make sure that that's correct.

03:18.710 --> 03:23.900
So we did data and nullify equals true method POST.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.200
Let's give it a name as well.

03:26.510 --> 03:30.960
So we'll say where is it form.

03:30.980 --> 03:37.190
Name equals call it contact.

03:37.190 --> 03:37.580
All right.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.020
So that should do it.

03:39.020 --> 03:39.820
Let's save.

03:39.830 --> 03:45.260
And then let's take this whole form and go to about Dot each symbol because obviously we wanted to work

03:45.260 --> 03:52.610
on all pages so we'll paste that in here and then let's go to Article dot each team out to the footer

03:53.120 --> 03:56.140
and do the same thing.

03:56.300 --> 03:56.620
OK.

03:56.630 --> 04:00.950
So now that we've updated that we're going to go back into our terminal and make sure you're in the

04:00.950 --> 04:07.010
news grid folder as you can see I am and we need to go get add all.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.820
So it's going to add anything that that has been changed is now in the staging area.

04:11.840 --> 04:12.920
So now we need to commit.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.440
Once again I'm going to say get commit.

04:15.440 --> 04:21.210
Dash M and then I'm going to say updated form.

04:21.850 --> 04:22.120
OK.

04:22.130 --> 04:26.870
So we're going to commit that you can see three files changed and now we need to push to get hub.

04:26.870 --> 04:34.070
Now we've already added it as a remote repository and all we have to do now to push our changes is simply

04:34.070 --> 04:36.980
get push.

04:37.140 --> 04:37.420
All right.

04:37.450 --> 04:42.940
So just doing that should go ahead and update our repository.

04:43.060 --> 04:44.080
It says one commit.

04:44.110 --> 04:49.540
If I reload now we have to commits and if we look at one of these each time all files we should see

04:49.540 --> 04:50.200
the changes.

04:50.200 --> 04:55.000
So let's go down to the form and there it is.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.660
So there's what we added.

04:56.860 --> 05:04.140
Let's go to our Web site nullify site and reload and let's take a look at the source code.

05:04.150 --> 05:04.870
So I did.

05:04.870 --> 05:08.450
I'm on a max I did command option you.

05:08.680 --> 05:21.750
And if we go down you can see that the form now this it's going to look different than what we actually

05:21.750 --> 05:22.460
uploaded.

05:22.470 --> 05:24.090
So it has a method of post.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.840
You can see the name is contact.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.680
What it does though is it puts a hidden value in here.

05:28.710 --> 05:28.980
OK.

05:29.010 --> 05:35.550
So basically now the fi needs this to to process the form but it has changed.

05:35.550 --> 05:40.740
Maybe we should change something else just so I could prove it to you but it is there it should work.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.540
So let's try it out.

05:42.540 --> 05:46.190
Let's go down to the e-mail and let's say test.

05:46.230 --> 05:57.030
We'll just do test at test dot com and subscribe and look at that nullify actually gives us a success

05:57.030 --> 05:57.480
page.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.170
We don't even have to deal with that.

05:59.310 --> 06:01.320
And then we can just go back to our site.

06:01.440 --> 06:09.390
Now if we go back to notify and we go down we go to overview right here you can see recent form submissions

06:09.600 --> 06:11.810
and we have test at test dot com.

06:11.820 --> 06:17.340
If I click on that it's going to show us the e-mail field in any other fields we have if we had you

06:17.340 --> 06:21.630
know name and address and all that stuff that would also show here.

06:21.810 --> 06:28.650
OK we can delete these so we can manage all of our submissions from here we can also download them as

06:28.800 --> 06:30.780
CSP file.

06:30.780 --> 06:31.050
All right.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.210
So really really cool service.

06:33.210 --> 06:35.260
Definitely recommend it.

06:35.460 --> 06:40.380
Now the next thing I want to do is I want to set up a custom domain.

06:40.410 --> 06:40.760
OK.

06:40.770 --> 06:46.440
So in the next video I'm going to show you how we can register a domain name from name cheap and we

06:46.440 --> 06:49.530
can basically link it to our net low fi Web site.
