WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.830
All right guys.

00:00.840 --> 00:05.700
Now we're going to jump into media queries and I'm actually going to do this in our CSF sandbox.

00:05.700 --> 00:13.830
So I'm going to add a file here called 1 3 13 because we left off at 12:00 media underscore queries

00:14.100 --> 00:22.260
dot h t email and we're gonna put our boiler plate in with Emmet so exclamation enter a tab at our title

00:25.530 --> 00:27.590
and for the body.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.730
This isn't going to be a very practical use of media queries we're gonna do that later on and all our

00:32.730 --> 00:33.800
projects.

00:33.870 --> 00:37.940
This is more to get you familiar with how they work in the syntax.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.560
So I'm going to have a few divs here.

00:40.680 --> 00:41.940
So actually we don't even need that.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.380
Let's do an I.D..

00:43.510 --> 00:46.480
A div with an idea of wide screen.

00:47.370 --> 00:53.640
And inside here I'm going to put an H and then I'm just gonna put the text wide screen and the names

00:53.640 --> 00:55.080
of these did these ideas.

00:55.080 --> 00:59.820
They have nothing to do with media queries it's just what I'm choosing to use because I want to give

00:59.820 --> 01:05.880
you an example of each screen size and how we can add separate styles for them.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.030
So it's clear the So and this one is gonna be normal.

01:10.050 --> 01:15.040
Normal size computer size whatever you want to call it.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.080
This one is gonna be tablet.

01:20.550 --> 01:23.320
And this one is gonna be smartphone

01:29.580 --> 01:36.520
and this one we're gonna do landscape.

01:37.350 --> 01:37.710
OK.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.770
We can do media queries for both width and height.

01:41.100 --> 01:45.200
So let's save this and let's open this up with a live server.

01:45.330 --> 01:46.740
So that's what it's going to look like.

01:46.740 --> 01:53.650
Now we're gonna put all of our CSX up in the head area just for convenience usually it would be on us

01:53.730 --> 02:00.420
in a separate CSX file and I'm going to add some core styles for the body.

02:00.420 --> 02:09.560
So let's just add a better font family we'll do aerial and let's do a background of gray.

02:09.570 --> 02:15.690
I'm just going to use color names just for convenience because what I want to happen is I want to have

02:15.690 --> 02:20.690
a different background color for each device or each of these divs here.

02:20.820 --> 02:22.380
So let's see what else.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.790
Let's align to the center

02:27.680 --> 02:32.680
and let's do a padding top of 100 pixels.

02:32.780 --> 02:33.080
All right.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.170
So we'll save that.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.070
It's going to look like this.

02:36.380 --> 02:43.420
Now as far as testing your your media queries and breakpoints you can resize the browser.

02:43.450 --> 02:44.300
OK that'll work.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.730
It'll update in real time.

02:46.730 --> 02:53.540
Another way to do it and a way that you should definitely do it even if you test to begin with with

02:53.540 --> 02:58.400
the browser you should always check them out with the chrome tools so I'm going to open up my chrome

02:58.400 --> 03:00.140
tools and hit this icon here.

03:00.140 --> 03:06.320
This is the device toolbar and this actually allows you to test your web page on different devices as

03:06.320 --> 03:11.200
you can see the iPhone X we have iPhone 6 7 8 plus 6 7 8.

03:11.210 --> 03:18.650
Even the 5 which you can see is much smaller pixel to excel pixel to galaxy and then we also have the

03:18.740 --> 03:24.950
iPad so you can test for tablets before the iPad Pro which is basically the same with us as a laptop

03:24.980 --> 03:26.250
would be.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.400
But we do we can test with that as well.

03:29.540 --> 03:36.680
So I usually test mostly with the iPhone 6 7 8 and the iPhone X but yeah.

03:36.680 --> 03:43.010
This is you're going to see some things here that you won't notice if you just use the browser because

03:43.010 --> 03:48.890
of the height in the browser you have a much bigger height than you do on actual smart so you don't

03:48.890 --> 03:51.660
get a real look at what it looks like on a smartphone.

03:52.190 --> 03:59.510
But I'm going to close this for now by clicking the icon again and we're going to go back in here and

03:59.510 --> 04:04.660
inside my my CSX usually this would be in a separate file but I can do it here as well.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.000
I'm going to add my first media query.

04:07.160 --> 04:14.080
So we do this by doing at media some parentheses and then inside here we can put a max width or amend

04:14.210 --> 04:22.280
with or max height or I mean height but I'm going to do max width and set it to 500 pixels and then

04:22.280 --> 04:24.280
we open up some curly braces.

04:24.290 --> 04:30.850
Now another thing I want to show you here in the device is it shows you the width and the height.

04:31.130 --> 04:38.840
OK so an iPhone X has a width of 375 pixels for Levin galaxy is 360.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.810
Notice that they're all under 500.

04:40.810 --> 04:44.950
So that's usually what I use for smartphones.

04:45.050 --> 04:55.760
So I'm going to go right here and say smartphones and let's take the body and let's change the background

04:56.360 --> 04:57.510
to red.

04:57.520 --> 04:57.790
OK.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.590
By default it's gray.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.060
I should say the core style or the default styling is gray.

05:04.070 --> 05:11.090
But as you can see when we test on an iPhone X or any of these devices it's red and I can close this

05:11.090 --> 05:17.680
up and just drag the browser make it smaller once it hits 500 it turns red.

05:18.340 --> 05:18.560
OK.

05:18.740 --> 05:23.450
And you can also do a min with if I do mean with it's going to do the opposite.

05:23.470 --> 05:27.680
It's going to be red until I hit 500 pixels.

05:27.680 --> 05:35.030
Now when you do mobile first design usually you'll put you'll do all your base styling as as you would

05:35.030 --> 05:39.450
on a mobile screen and then you add your men width for larger screens.

05:39.450 --> 05:44.550
OK but we'll get into that later but I'm going to put this back to Max.

05:45.080 --> 05:51.570
So the other thing that I want to do is only display the heading for that screen size.

05:51.650 --> 05:57.700
So by default I'm going to set each one all age ones to have a display of none.

05:57.790 --> 05:58.130
OK.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.290
Which will make them just disappear completely.

06:00.290 --> 06:07.360
So we'll save that and then down in our media query for our smartphone for 500 pixels or less.

06:07.420 --> 06:15.950
I'm going to target the I.D. smartphone each one and I'm going to set the display to its normal value

06:15.950 --> 06:17.300
of block.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.080
And there we go.

06:18.080 --> 06:23.600
So now it only displays when it's 500 pixels or less.

06:23.600 --> 06:23.920
OK.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.700
Now let's add another one for tablet.

06:25.700 --> 06:36.580
I'm going to just copy this whole thing here and let's add tablets and usually a tablet is around 768.

06:36.590 --> 06:39.050
That's a common break point for tablets.

06:39.050 --> 06:47.060
I'm going to set this to blue and let's grab the I.D. of tablet and display the H1.

06:47.120 --> 06:47.480
All right.

06:47.480 --> 06:54.440
Now notice that even though we're under five hundred pixels this is still applying because always said

06:54.440 --> 06:57.040
was the max width of 768.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.360
And that includes five hundred and less.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.100
So anything under 768.

07:01.100 --> 07:07.110
So if we wanted to target everything under 768 we could just do this.

07:07.190 --> 07:13.700
There's not even any need for this but if we want a different style for smartphones and then something

07:13.700 --> 07:17.650
different for tablets what we would do is a mini width.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.460
Next we're going to go right here.

07:19.760 --> 07:31.110
Open up another set of curly braces and say men with do 5 0 1 pixels and a max width of 768.

07:31.670 --> 07:40.330
So if I save that now when I get down to 500 notice it goes back to red it just shows the styling because

07:40.330 --> 07:43.990
this media query is 5 0 1 to 5 2.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.610
I'm sorry 768.

07:47.290 --> 07:48.630
OK.

07:48.790 --> 07:58.470
Another thing I want to mention is that you might you might sometimes see this at media only screen

07:59.480 --> 08:02.460
and and then the max or min with or whatever.

08:02.470 --> 08:06.040
Now the reason for this is because screen is one of the media types.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.220
There's screen print and I believe speech.

08:10.270 --> 08:14.850
And sometimes you'll see this and it just means this only applies to screens.

08:14.890 --> 08:19.930
I usually leave this off because the default is all so it will show for it doesn't matter the media

08:19.930 --> 08:27.190
type but if you see this it just means that it's only four screens all right so let's move on here let's

08:27.190 --> 08:27.590
do that.

08:27.630 --> 08:29.340
The normal size.

08:30.050 --> 08:37.410
So going to copy this and paste that in and let's change the values here.

08:37.870 --> 08:40.400
So this ends at 768.

08:40.420 --> 08:47.070
So let's do a min width of seven sixty nine and we'll go to let's say twelve hundred.

08:48.270 --> 08:55.110
I'm going to set the green are the background to green and then I only want the normal I.D. H1 to show

08:55.140 --> 08:56.450
so I'll save that.

08:56.550 --> 09:05.390
And now from seven sixty nine to twelve hundred we get that green normal we hit 768 tablet we had 500

09:05.720 --> 09:07.100
Smartphone.

09:07.270 --> 09:07.590
All right.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.010
And then finally let's do the widescreen.

09:10.020 --> 09:17.750
So I'm just gonna paste this in again and we'll see a wide screen and four wide screen.

09:17.760 --> 09:23.350
I'm just gonna do anything above twelve hundred or twelve twelve hundred and one I should say.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.380
So we don't need a range.

09:25.380 --> 09:37.070
We can simply do men with 12 or 1 and we can just get rid of this and let's make it black and the I.D.

09:37.090 --> 09:47.590
of wide screen So now once they hit twelve or one we get wide screen and it's gonna it's gonna stay

09:47.590 --> 09:50.370
like that as large as I go.

09:50.700 --> 09:51.020
OK.

09:51.030 --> 09:55.540
So as you can see we're just hitting breakpoints and then those styles are kicking in.

09:55.540 --> 10:00.610
Now usually you're not going to have all of these you're not going to have separate styles for every

10:00.610 --> 10:08.650
single device but you might for instance have floats on your normal you know you might have two sections

10:08.650 --> 10:11.020
that are float floated left and right.

10:11.080 --> 10:17.080
Or better yet the Flex will use flex in the grid system later on but then when you get to smaller screens

10:17.320 --> 10:22.570
you want them to be on top of each other because it looks ridiculous floated like that on very small

10:22.570 --> 10:28.210
screens so you would add a media query for a mobile device and just set the float to none.

10:28.510 --> 10:31.570
And that's exactly what we're gonna do in our hotel website.

10:31.810 --> 10:34.270
But this is the syntax for media queries.

10:34.480 --> 10:42.880
So let's test this out in the device toolbar So I'm to open up my chrome tools and hit the device toolbar.

10:42.880 --> 10:49.950
So any smartphone should just be read because they're all under 500 pixels wide.

10:50.320 --> 10:58.210
And then if I go to the iPad we get the tablet as you can see it's seven sixty eight and then I Pad

10:58.210 --> 11:06.220
Pro is gonna be normal because it's 10 24 OK in an iPad Pro is pretty wide it's it's pretty much like

11:06.220 --> 11:08.360
a laptop OK.

11:08.410 --> 11:16.030
Now for landscape what we would do is probably set a height because actually let me make this a little

11:16.030 --> 11:22.480
bigger because if we hit this icon here let's go back to iPhone and we'll hit that and it shows this

11:22.480 --> 11:26.230
landscape and the width is 812.

11:26.250 --> 11:34.960
So it falls into normal but let's add another one here just copy this

11:37.650 --> 11:44.760
and say you'll change this landscape let's do a max

11:47.160 --> 12:01.940
height of 500 pixels and we're gonna change the background to Orange and let's say landscape H1 and

12:01.940 --> 12:02.870
we'll save that.

12:03.410 --> 12:09.200
And now notice that it's orange we get in landscape it's also going to show normal because of the width.

12:09.360 --> 12:09.730
OK.

12:09.750 --> 12:13.100
It's it's also whatever we have for the width still applies.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.660
We're just adding some for the height as well.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.040
All right.

12:16.040 --> 12:22.220
And if this is confusing don't worry about it just like anything else that that may have confused you

12:22.220 --> 12:25.180
we're going to we're going gonna touch on all of this stuff as we move along.

12:25.190 --> 12:25.780
So you're going to.

12:25.810 --> 12:29.000
It's going to make sense it's going to click OK.

12:29.050 --> 12:33.590
So the last thing I want to show you is that we can actually have separate style sheets as our media

12:33.590 --> 12:37.570
query if you don't want to embed the media query into a style sheet.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.730
You can have a separate one so just for an example.

12:40.730 --> 12:43.490
I'm going to create a new file.

12:43.490 --> 12:46.310
I'm actually going to delete this after which is to show you.

12:46.310 --> 12:56.360
We could do like let's say a style she called Mobile dot CSX and go up to the head and just like we

12:56.360 --> 13:05.330
add any style sheet we could use a link tag Rel style sheet and we can point to mobile dot CSX.

13:05.330 --> 13:14.510
Now right now it'll always load that style sheet but we can actually add a media attribute and in our

13:14.510 --> 13:25.010
media attribute we're gonna say screen and and then open some parentheses and let's do a max width of

13:25.110 --> 13:28.270
768 pixels.

13:28.280 --> 13:35.290
Now what this is going to do is it's only going to load this style sheet if the screen is 768 or less.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.760
So basically a tablet or less.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.650
Otherwise it's not going to load.

13:39.710 --> 13:44.840
Now you always want to have this after your main style sheet.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.040
In fact this isn't even going to do what I want because our style.

13:48.200 --> 13:59.280
It's down here so I'm going to move this below are style tags so we'll go right here because you want

13:59.280 --> 14:06.600
your main styling up here and then down here we have our mobile so in our mobile CSX.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.590
Where is it.

14:07.710 --> 14:08.510
Right here.

14:08.610 --> 14:19.380
I'm going to actually take the body and I'm going to add a background of pink so once I save that once

14:19.380 --> 14:23.100
I hit 768 notice that it's pink.

14:23.520 --> 14:31.380
And it doesn't matter if it's tablet or smartphone because I said it to 768 and it's after the rest

14:31.380 --> 14:32.180
of our styling.

14:32.190 --> 14:34.690
So it's going to take precedence.

14:34.690 --> 14:37.410
OK but yeah you can do that as well.

14:37.410 --> 14:47.280
I'm actually going to delete the that mobile CSX and then I'm just going to comment out the link to

14:47.280 --> 14:50.450
it just so you have it as a reference.

14:50.460 --> 14:50.760
All right.

14:50.790 --> 14:55.800
So let's media queries and like I said we're going to get more into them but before we do that I want

14:55.800 --> 15:03.750
to take a look at certain relative units in CSX such as REM am as well as viewport heights and viewport

15:03.780 --> 15:04.680
widths.

15:04.680 --> 15:04.980
All right.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.390
So I'll see you in the next video.
