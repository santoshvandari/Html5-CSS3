00:00.360 --> 00:07.140
All right in this video we're going to look at link styling links and buttons and links are kind of

00:07.140 --> 00:11.820
special because they have different states you have here your regular links your regular state and you

00:11.820 --> 00:17.310
have your hover state in active state and a visited state and you can actually style those different

00:17.310 --> 00:19.960
states using something called a pseudo selector.

00:20.070 --> 00:24.990
And I'm also going to show you how to how to style buttons and also how to style a link as a button

00:25.020 --> 00:31.170
because a lot of times you'll have actual a tags that you want to look like buttons in your web site

00:31.170 --> 00:33.400
or your user interface.

00:33.420 --> 00:42.710
So let's go ahead and create a new file here called 08 underscore links underscore buttons dot HDMI.

00:44.880 --> 00:51.410
And we're going to go ahead and change title up to links and buttons.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.210
OK.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.510
And let's add our style.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.960
And for now we'll just put in a tag does it have to.

00:59.970 --> 01:06.660
Doesn't matter where it goes and just say click here and save let's open it up with live server and

01:06.720 --> 01:12.420
we just have a simple link and it's going to be blue by default with an underline which doesn't look

01:12.420 --> 01:12.950
very good.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.270
So I'm going to grab on to that a tag here.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.510
Use that as a selector.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.970
I'm going to change the color to a dark gray and then to remove the underline.

01:22.980 --> 01:28.360
We want to use the text decoration property and we want to set that to none.

01:28.360 --> 01:28.700
OK.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.570
So the default is underlined.

01:30.570 --> 01:32.550
We're gonna set it to none.

01:32.550 --> 01:37.290
Now if I hover over it you'll see we get a cursor the cursor changes into a pointer.

01:37.290 --> 01:39.920
But the nothing else changes.

01:39.930 --> 01:44.390
So you're probably going to want some kind of a change when you hover over it.

01:44.400 --> 01:52.890
Now to do that we can use the pseudo selector hover so we can do a colon and then hover and let's change

01:52.890 --> 01:56.130
the color to coral.

01:56.160 --> 02:02.190
So now if I go and I hover over it it changes to coral and you can you can add any properties you want

02:02.190 --> 02:08.820
here you could do something crazy like I would do font size changes to like 40 pixels.

02:08.820 --> 02:15.420
And now what I have for 0 4 it goes to 40 pixels font size so you can do whatever you want in the hover

02:15.420 --> 02:20.730
state but I'm not going to keep that and let's just change the color and if you want to add the underline

02:20.730 --> 02:29.730
on hover you could do text decoration underline and I could see that it gets colored and it's underlined.

02:29.730 --> 02:39.530
So in addition to hover we have visited so we can do a colon visited and let's just do color red.

02:39.540 --> 02:45.270
Now visited at least for me I know I don't use this very much I don't think I've ever used it actually

02:45.270 --> 02:46.650
in a real project.

02:47.010 --> 02:53.430
When you click on it and you visit it it then turns red and it stays red even if I reload the server

02:53.430 --> 02:54.660
it stays red.

02:54.660 --> 03:00.420
And if there were other links if we didn't click on them they'd be they'd be gray dark gray and then

03:00.420 --> 03:01.710
you'd click on and they turn red.

03:01.710 --> 03:07.890
So it's kind of weird and I really don't like it and it's not something that I use but it is possible.

03:07.920 --> 03:14.010
So I just want to show you that but that comment that out another state that we have four links is active.

03:14.010 --> 03:25.380
So if we do a colon active and let's say color red and now the active state is going to be when we click.

03:25.380 --> 03:30.270
So when I click see how it turns red and if I click and hold it also turns red.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.210
So that's the active state in that.

03:32.270 --> 03:37.620
That's another one that I really don't use but it is it is possible.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.450
So those are the different states for lengths.

03:39.450 --> 03:45.780
Now what I want to do is I want to style I'm going to put a button in here and style the link in the

03:45.780 --> 03:46.920
button the same way.

03:46.950 --> 03:48.320
So it's a button.

03:49.470 --> 03:55.040
And let's give both of these a class of B.T. end.

03:55.080 --> 03:55.330
OK.

03:55.350 --> 04:01.170
So this is often what we'll do in projects is we'll have different button classes sometimes we'll have

04:01.170 --> 04:07.230
like a B10 light if I want a light button Beaty and dark which will be this basically the same just

04:07.230 --> 04:08.240
different colors.

04:08.430 --> 04:12.960
But let's just do BTR and we'll say click here.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.440
Actually no.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.620
Let's put it in the text.

04:15.870 --> 04:26.550
My button just so we know that this is a button and then up here let's say my link and save and you

04:26.550 --> 04:32.840
can see that they're obviously formatted very differently initially but we want to make them the same.

04:32.850 --> 04:38.130
And I'm going to just make this bigger not that big.

04:38.130 --> 04:38.350
OK.

04:38.370 --> 04:39.960
So we have a link and a button.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.920
Let's let's see I want these on separate lines.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.520
They're both inline elements.

04:45.540 --> 04:51.400
So I'm going to just put a couple line breaks here just to kind of get them away from each other.

04:51.510 --> 04:54.600
So buttons obviously are styled differently.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.080
They have a border.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.070
They have a little bit of padding here the fonts different.

04:59.100 --> 05:09.020
So let's go up here into our styling and let's say button styling.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.250
So we have a class of B10

05:13.930 --> 05:17.930
and let's go ahead and add a background.

05:18.730 --> 05:23.780
And I'm going to use a blue that's like like a Facebook brand blue.

05:23.800 --> 05:35.390
So it's going to be for C six C a zero and let's set the color of the text to white.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.510
OK let's save that and see what we get.

05:37.510 --> 05:38.270
All right.

05:38.410 --> 05:43.930
Now we want to remove the border because buttons have borders going to say border.

05:43.930 --> 05:48.840
We could either do border none like that or we could do border zero.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.300
I usually use border none.

05:51.340 --> 05:52.330
So save that.

05:52.330 --> 05:55.510
Now the border is off the actual button.

05:55.510 --> 05:58.190
Next thing we want to do is is the font size.

05:58.340 --> 05:58.550
OK.

05:58.570 --> 06:05.220
We want the font size to be the same for all all links and buttons which we're going to set to 16 pixels.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.910
So we'll save that.

06:06.910 --> 06:07.770
Good.

06:07.780 --> 06:09.890
Next thing we'll do is the padding.

06:10.840 --> 06:16.720
So let's say we want to do 10 on the top and bottom and 20 left and right.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.430
Save that.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.500
And this is this is zoomed in that's why this is so big.

06:21.790 --> 06:24.830
Can actually zoom out a little bit now.

06:24.840 --> 06:25.520
Yeah.

06:25.630 --> 06:29.880
And let's change the font for the body.

06:30.730 --> 06:34.240
So I'm going to say font family.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.970
Let's grab this or is it to home.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.730
Sig you UI to Homer.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.630
OK that looks a little better.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.950
Back down to our button.

06:44.950 --> 06:46.780
Let's give it a little border radius.

06:47.770 --> 06:48.070
OK.

06:48.070 --> 06:50.290
And this is these are all properties that we've learned about.

06:50.290 --> 06:54.810
So we're kind of taking all the stuff that we've learned and actually creating an element that that's

06:54.820 --> 06:55.450
styled.

06:56.030 --> 06:56.210
OK.

06:56.230 --> 07:00.660
So now you can see they have the the rounded corners.

07:01.990 --> 07:08.590
Let's let's actually put a line break above the the a tag to just bring it down a little bit.

07:08.620 --> 07:08.890
All right.

07:08.890 --> 07:15.280
So these are these are pretty much identical now so for any button or any link with that we want to

07:15.280 --> 07:18.390
style this way we would just add the class APTN.

07:18.450 --> 07:18.780
OK.

07:18.850 --> 07:27.790
Globally Now one thing that I want to mention is the will go over this in a minute how the hover state

07:28.600 --> 07:32.460
but when we go over the actual button we don't get a cursor.

07:32.500 --> 07:41.170
We don't get a pointer on our cursor and for this we do K links by default you do get the pointer.

07:41.350 --> 07:48.280
So if we want the pointer to show up either way we can actually set that in the CSF so we can set cursor

07:48.280 --> 07:55.010
pointer and now when I go over the button you can see that it turns into a pointer now for the hover

07:55.010 --> 07:59.750
state so let's say Beatty and hover troops.

07:59.780 --> 08:03.510
We don't want a space there that won't work.

08:03.830 --> 08:09.790
So Beatty and hover and we're gonna set the color to too light gray.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.650
That's the text color and then the background.

08:13.970 --> 08:22.130
I'm gonna set that to just a slightly lighter blue than the one we have which is going to be 4 4 6 1

08:22.130 --> 08:24.900
9 0 OK.

08:25.130 --> 08:25.940
Or is it darker.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.250
I think it's yeah I think it's darker.

08:28.250 --> 08:34.310
And then I'm going to just get rid of the text decoration underline for the link up here even though

08:34.310 --> 08:41.240
we said links link covers should be coral down here we're saying the button hover should be light grey

08:41.240 --> 08:46.040
and this is going to overwrite that style so let's save let's go ahead and hover and you can see that

08:46.250 --> 08:54.740
the blue gets a little darker so you can't even distinguish the difference here between the the link

08:54.770 --> 08:57.910
the tag and the button tag and that's that's what we want.

08:58.280 --> 09:03.140
So that's what you're gonna do a lot in Web sites and especially in user interfaces where you have a

09:03.140 --> 09:07.400
lot of links that you want to format as buttons.

09:07.430 --> 09:15.080
All right so that's it guys in the next video what I want to do is start to look at menus creating vertical

09:15.080 --> 09:17.650
and horizontal navigation bars.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.370
So we'll get into that next.
