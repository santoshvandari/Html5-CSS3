WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:00.500
All right.

00:00.510 --> 00:05.700
So up to this point we've only looked at HCM Al which is definitely needed we needed to actually put

00:05.700 --> 00:13.380
stuff on the page but by itself it's very ugly we need CSX to style it and move things around and in

00:13.400 --> 00:19.170
a line and add colors and background and anything else that has to do with layout and style.

00:19.170 --> 00:22.640
So in this section we're going to look at all the basics of CSX.

00:22.800 --> 00:28.260
So let's go ahead and create a new folder and just like we did with aged him out we're going to create

00:28.260 --> 00:29.030
a sandbox.

00:29.040 --> 00:36.250
So I'm going to call this CSX sandbox and these files will be in the lecture.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.700
The Last Lecture the introduction if you want to download those or you can just create them along with

00:41.700 --> 00:42.350
me.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.970
So I'm going to open this with V.S. code.

00:44.970 --> 00:52.920
So in Visual Studio code I'm just going to go ahead and open folder and open up CSF sandbox and we're

00:52.920 --> 01:02.430
going to create in here a new file and I'm going to call this just we'll call it basic dot a 0 1 underscore

01:02.520 --> 01:04.680
basic dot HD CML.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.760
So I'm just numbering them so you know what order we're going in.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.640
And again you don't have to number them.

01:10.830 --> 01:18.330
And if you didn't watch the last section the H Al section we are using an extension called live server

01:18.360 --> 01:23.070
so that we can open our each team all file in a little server and it will auto reload.

01:23.070 --> 01:26.390
So you just want to install that if you don't have that yet.

01:26.400 --> 01:26.820
All right.

01:26.850 --> 01:34.260
I also went over some tips and tricks with shortcuts as well as Emmett which allows us to write faster

01:34.260 --> 01:40.530
aged him out so we can actually do exclamation and hit enter or tab and it'll give us this basic HD

01:40.550 --> 01:42.250
hymnal structure.

01:42.260 --> 01:42.630
OK.

01:42.630 --> 01:48.570
So in the title here I'm going to call this implementing CSX because I want to talk about the different

01:48.570 --> 01:54.900
ways we can actually bring in CSX and we're going to look a little bit at selectors but we're going

01:54.900 --> 01:57.740
to talk more about that in the next video.

01:57.930 --> 02:04.450
So let's put some basic H Tim Allen here I'm going to put an H one and just say heading one and then

02:04.450 --> 02:10.530
I'm going to copy this down by doing shift option or shift Ault on a Windows machine and then hit the

02:10.530 --> 02:12.480
down arrow twice.

02:12.480 --> 02:25.440
So this will be heading to and heading three and let's actually make this an H to make this an h three.

02:25.730 --> 02:26.200
OK.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.120
And I'm going to save this and then we're going to open with live server.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.230
OK.

02:31.230 --> 02:32.570
And right now I have this.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.680
I haven't both.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.750
You know the browser and the editor on the same screen.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.920
But later on we're gonna have to make this bigger.

02:40.070 --> 02:43.590
We're going to build a real web sites and stuff.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.330
So we have three headings on the screen and I'm going to show you three different ways to implement

02:48.330 --> 02:49.410
CSX.

02:49.410 --> 02:56.670
The first is called inline CSX which is not something that you want to do but it is something you should

02:56.670 --> 03:01.170
know and this is what we've been what we were doing in the last the last section.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.280
The h him I'll section when I just wanted to show you a couple examples of stuff.

03:05.280 --> 03:11.190
So we use the style tag and you can actually put CSX in here like let's say we want to use the color

03:11.190 --> 03:13.850
property and we want to set that to red.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.990
If I go ahead and save that the heading turns red.

03:17.010 --> 03:19.880
Now you don't want to do this and the reason for that is you want to.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.220
You want to keep.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.890
It's called separation of concerns you want to keep your styling out of your markup.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.940
You want to keep those two things separate.

03:29.100 --> 03:32.310
And when you do it like this you're just clumping it all together.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.660
It's much harder to read.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.860
It's much harder to change.

03:35.910 --> 03:40.760
It's just not good practice and any developer will give you crap for doing this.

03:40.760 --> 03:46.340
So this is not something you want to do but it's something that you should know you can do.

03:46.350 --> 03:46.730
All right.

03:46.740 --> 03:52.890
So next one I want to show you is called internal CSX where it's still on the same page it's on this

03:52.920 --> 03:59.010
HCM Al page but it's separate from your HMO the way that you do this is INSIDE YOUR HEAD tag.

03:59.190 --> 04:01.700
You put in a style tag.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.030
OK.

04:02.040 --> 04:09.240
And then in here you can just put CSX now with when you're using CSX you need a way to select whatever

04:09.240 --> 04:10.400
it is you want to style.

04:10.410 --> 04:13.280
Let's say we want to change the color of this age.

04:13.500 --> 04:20.280
Well we can use the actual element as the selector so I can say H2 and then open some curly braces and

04:20.280 --> 04:23.330
I can put as many styles in here as I want.

04:23.370 --> 04:34.250
So let's say we want color and let's let's add green and if I save that notice that it turns green.

04:34.320 --> 04:34.680
All right.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.600
Now let's go over this syntax really quick.

04:37.710 --> 04:42.150
So if we take a look here I mean this is similar to what we just did except we use color instead of

04:42.150 --> 04:43.140
background color.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.160
But the first thing here is a selector in this case it's in a tag.

04:47.160 --> 04:53.550
What we just did was we did the H1 than we did the H2 and you can use the actual tag as a selector but

04:53.550 --> 04:58.830
you can also use I.D. classes there's something called pseudo selectors.

04:58.830 --> 05:03.470
There's a lot of different things we can do for our selectors and we're going to get into that in the

05:03.470 --> 05:06.010
next video as well as later on.

05:06.020 --> 05:06.950
So that's the selector.

05:06.950 --> 05:09.380
Then we have the declarations start.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.410
We also have the declaration end.

05:11.420 --> 05:18.470
So everything goes within these curly braces and inside the curly braces we have a property such as

05:18.470 --> 05:21.170
background color or color as you just saw.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.490
And then the value.

05:22.550 --> 05:23.170
OK.

05:23.180 --> 05:27.900
And in between that we have the property value separator which is a colon.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.250
All right.

05:28.280 --> 05:33.380
So you have the property and value and you can add more of these if we wanted to add a color we could

05:33.380 --> 05:34.480
do that as well.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.210
You just want to end each one with a semicolon.

05:37.220 --> 05:43.270
So this is the basically the just a diagram of how CSX works.

05:43.310 --> 05:49.580
So we've looked at two ways to add CSX line which you don't want to do and then internal.

05:49.580 --> 05:53.720
And I'm just going to put a comment here and you can have comments in CSX as well.

05:53.870 --> 06:00.440
If I hold down control and hit the question mark or forward slash you'll see that it adds in a forward

06:00.440 --> 06:03.260
slash asterisk and ends with an asterisk.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.040
Forward slash.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.930
This is a CSX comment.

06:05.930 --> 06:15.250
So in here I'm just going to say that this is internal CSX all right so going to save that and I'm going

06:15.250 --> 06:21.310
to show you the third way which is external CSX where you actually have a separate file that you bring

06:21.310 --> 06:23.130
in that has all your CSX.

06:23.140 --> 06:24.820
So let's create a folder.

06:24.820 --> 06:29.980
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to click the folder icon and call this folder CSX.

06:30.220 --> 06:34.800
And in here let's create a file called style dot CSX.

06:34.810 --> 06:38.090
That's a common name for a for main style sheet.

06:38.200 --> 06:42.550
And you can include more than one style sheet if you want as well.

06:42.580 --> 06:47.890
So now that we have a separate file let's start let's grab this h three right here.

06:47.890 --> 06:53.930
So I'm going to use the H three element as a selector and I'm going to do color blue.

06:54.470 --> 06:54.790
OK.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.880
And we want to end that with a semicolon.

06:56.890 --> 07:01.180
Now if I save this you'll notice that the the h three is not is not blue.

07:01.180 --> 07:07.120
And the reason for that is this file has no clue that it's supposed to look at that that style dot CSX.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.930
We actually have to bring that in.

07:09.070 --> 07:11.770
And the way that we do that is with a link tag.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.140
OK.

07:12.180 --> 07:15.170
HDL has a link tag that we can use in the header.

07:15.190 --> 07:21.430
So we'll say link and then we'll hit enter a tab and it gives us some necessary attributes such as Rel

07:21.700 --> 07:27.940
this tells it basically what what type of link exists for a style sheet and then in a trap just like

07:27.940 --> 07:29.280
with the tags.

07:29.320 --> 07:34.870
This points to the location that we want to basically load which in our case is in the folder called

07:34.870 --> 07:36.070
CSX.

07:36.070 --> 07:41.440
And it's a file called style dot CSX.

07:41.500 --> 07:45.190
So if I save this now you'll see that the H two three changes blue.

07:45.220 --> 07:48.080
That's because we're now including this file.

07:48.110 --> 07:52.800
OK if we don't have this if I comment this file out and save it's not going to read it.

07:52.870 --> 07:56.890
So you want to make sure that you include your style sheets.

07:57.010 --> 08:04.420
Now out of these three this is the preferred using an external CSX file when we build our projects when

08:04.420 --> 08:08.440
we create a Web site all our CSX will be in a separate file.

08:08.440 --> 08:14.650
However for this sandbox for this section I'm going to be doing it this way because I don't want for

08:14.650 --> 08:20.920
a couple of reasons one reason I don't want to have to go back and forth to to go to my CSX.

08:20.950 --> 08:24.040
I also want you guys to get a big picture of what's going on.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.480
So I want you to see the HD Himmel and the CSX at the same time.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.100
But usually you would do it this way you would have a separate file.

08:32.100 --> 08:32.320
OK.

08:32.350 --> 08:34.120
So just keep that in mind.

08:34.150 --> 08:40.810
So in the next video we're going to start to look at how to use I.D. and classes for selectors how to

08:40.810 --> 08:45.340
use multiple selectors nested selectors things like that.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.810
So I will see you in the next video.
