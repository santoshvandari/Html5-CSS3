WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:00.750
All right.

00:00.780 --> 00:07.580
So now we're going to do is initialize a get repository and push it to get hub dot com.

00:07.620 --> 00:10.740
So I have my news grid Web site right here.

00:10.740 --> 00:16.960
So if I open it up and they open up the index each time all we have the Web site that we built in the

00:17.370 --> 00:19.260
was the last section.

00:19.440 --> 00:25.920
And what we need to do is open this folder up inside of a terminal or a command line which is basically

00:25.920 --> 00:27.080
the same thing.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.430
Now if you're on Windows and you downloaded get which you should have you should be able to right click

00:32.490 --> 00:41.400
and say open with a get bash or if you want you can say open with the Gates is open with command line.

00:41.460 --> 00:50.940
If not then just go down to the windows icon and just type in inside the run text box type in C D and

00:50.940 --> 00:53.370
you'll get your command line open.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.980
Now if you're on a Mac you'll use your terminal.

00:56.580 --> 01:03.120
If you can't find where it is just go to the search up in the top right and type in terminal and hit

01:03.150 --> 01:06.090
enter and your terminal should open like that.

01:06.090 --> 01:10.950
Now you're going to have to be in the news grid sites if you right click and you say open with get bash

01:10.950 --> 01:12.730
you'll be already be in there.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.030
But for me in my home directory now my project is on my desktop.

01:18.060 --> 01:25.340
If I do an L S command and by the way I do have a command line crash course on YouTube as well.

01:25.470 --> 01:31.650
But if I do an atlas it shows me all the folders that are in here and you can see that desktop is is

01:31.650 --> 01:37.720
in here so I'm going to see D which means change directory into desktop.

01:38.070 --> 01:38.460
OK.

01:38.460 --> 01:42.020
Now if I do another alas it shows me everything that's on my desktop.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.770
I want to see these into my news grid Web site or folder.

01:46.770 --> 01:51.210
And if I do an L s you can see all the files that we have that we created.

01:51.210 --> 01:58.740
Now to initialize a get repository locally and you should first actually check to see if you have get

01:58.770 --> 02:03.870
so do get dash dash version and it should show you a virgin.

02:03.870 --> 02:04.320
OK.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.430
And I'm going to clear this up.

02:05.430 --> 02:09.160
We can clear this up with control Al or it might be.

02:09.220 --> 02:09.440
Yeah.

02:09.450 --> 02:15.060
Command and Control Al and then we're gonna do get init.

02:15.120 --> 02:15.410
OK.

02:15.420 --> 02:18.600
So this will initialize a get repository.

02:18.660 --> 02:22.630
What it does is it creates a hidden folder called dot get.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.750
If I do an L S we don't see it.

02:24.750 --> 02:31.290
However if I do l s and I add the dash a flag that means that it's going to show everything even hidden

02:31.290 --> 02:32.760
hidden files and folders.

02:32.790 --> 02:36.770
And now you can see that there is actually a dot get folder here.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.960
All right.

02:37.980 --> 02:44.850
Now we need to we need to add our files to our Get repository.

02:44.850 --> 02:51.960
So I'm going to go ahead and say Get add and instead of doing right writing out every file we can simply

02:51.960 --> 02:53.010
put a dot.

02:53.010 --> 02:58.950
That means get add all OK I'm going to run that and it's going to add it to what's called the staging

02:58.950 --> 02:59.970
area.

02:59.970 --> 03:00.290
All right.

03:00.420 --> 03:06.450
If we want to see what's in that staging area we can say get status and you'll see all of our files

03:06.450 --> 03:08.200
our images everything.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.960
So they're in the staging area.

03:09.960 --> 03:17.780
And now I want to commit them to our local repository so to do that we say get commit and we're going

03:17.780 --> 03:19.820
to put a dash M flag here.

03:19.830 --> 03:26.430
And then inside of quotes just put a comment as to to what what we did what is this commit about.

03:26.430 --> 03:30.010
So we're going to say initial commit since this is our first one.

03:30.850 --> 03:31.150
OK.

03:31.170 --> 03:36.320
So once we do that all of those files get committed to our local repository.

03:36.330 --> 03:41.100
Now what we want to do is take that local repository and push it to get hub dot com.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.680
So let's head over to get hub.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.750
Now once you sign up and you log in you'll see something like this and you just want to go up to the

03:48.750 --> 03:51.900
plus sign and say new repository.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.190
All right.

03:52.200 --> 03:58.620
And then right here you want to put your repository name so I'm going to say news grid and you can put

03:58.620 --> 03:59.840
a description if you want.

03:59.840 --> 04:06.500
We'll just say I don't know I'm just going to say sample Web site.

04:06.570 --> 04:14.450
Now here you can choose public or private and private repositories were premium for a long long time.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.880
But I believe that they just made them free.

04:17.880 --> 04:23.190
Microsoft actually acquired GitHub and I believe they made private depositories free.

04:23.340 --> 04:29.550
And what that means is that if they're private other people can't see them unless you invite them.

04:29.610 --> 04:30.760
If it's public.

04:30.780 --> 04:34.130
Other people will be able to see all your code.

04:34.410 --> 04:39.420
So you know this is a place for public repositories for open source code.

04:39.420 --> 04:40.960
I'm going to choose private.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.840
You guys can choose public if you want.

04:42.840 --> 04:48.540
I just choose private because I have quite a few followers and this is a repository that I'm not going

04:48.540 --> 04:49.020
to keep.

04:49.020 --> 04:52.010
So I don't want people to see it and stuff like that.

04:52.010 --> 04:57.590
So I'm just going to choose private and then I'm going to say create repository.

04:57.610 --> 04:57.850
All right.

04:57.880 --> 05:03.190
Now this pretty much gives us instructions on how to push to get hub.

05:03.430 --> 05:08.770
But there's a couple of things that we don't need like we don't need a read me file but we did already

05:08.770 --> 05:10.040
did this get in it.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.870
We already add it all up for all of our files.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.440
Like I said we don't need to read me so we're not going to do that.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.190
And then we did our commit.

05:17.190 --> 05:17.450
OK.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.640
We did get commit.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.620
Dash M initial commit.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.770
Now we need to add this as our remote repository.

05:23.770 --> 05:29.140
Now if we use this right here if we use SSA which is what's being used you'll need to create what are

05:29.140 --> 05:34.900
called SSA keys which make it so that you don't have to log in every time you push to get hub which

05:34.900 --> 05:39.640
is something you probably want to look into but I'm not going to do that here I'm actually going to

05:39.640 --> 05:45.870
choose H GDP s so I'm going to click this right here and then I'm going to grab this command.

05:45.940 --> 05:51.460
So I'm going to control c I'm going to copy it copy it and then I'm going to paste it in here and run

05:51.460 --> 05:57.460
it and then we want to grab this get push dash you origin master.

05:57.460 --> 06:02.260
So basically we're just saying we want to push to the master branch because and get you can have different

06:02.260 --> 06:03.730
branches.

06:03.730 --> 06:09.370
And that's something that you'll learn about later but we're gonna go ahead and copy that command and

06:09.370 --> 06:16.560
put that in here and it's going to push to get hub case.

06:16.660 --> 06:23.760
Now if I go back and I reload you can see all of our files all of our age team all files are I icon

06:24.090 --> 06:29.790
this DSA store I probably shouldn't have pushed but I didn't want to get into the whole get ignore file

06:29.790 --> 06:30.300
and all that.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.640
I want to keep this very basic.

06:31.650 --> 06:34.430
So I mean it's not going to hurt anything to have this file.

06:34.530 --> 06:36.210
And if you're on Windows you won't have this.

06:36.210 --> 06:37.940
This is a Mac thing.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.610
Then we have our CSX.

06:39.660 --> 06:47.360
We can even look at our code in GitHub but our news good Web site is now a repository is now on github.

06:48.120 --> 06:56.010
So in the next video what I want to do is go to nettled Fi and deploy it basically take this this repository

06:56.280 --> 07:02.550
and deploy it to nullify so that we can actually view it in the browser it'll give us very strange domain

07:02.550 --> 07:05.960
name at first and then we'll add our own custom domain.
