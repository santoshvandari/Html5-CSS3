WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:04.020
All right guys so in the last video we started the about page.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.900
So now we're gonna move on to the progress section of the about page which goes underneath this info

00:09.900 --> 00:10.500
section.

00:10.500 --> 00:22.110
So let's go to the about each team L and go down below the last section we'll say Section B which is

00:22.110 --> 00:26.960
the progress bars.

00:27.090 --> 00:34.230
So this is basically like level of skill for four different technologies or topics whatever it may be.

00:34.230 --> 00:39.250
So let's do section we'll call this about Dash B.

00:39.630 --> 00:47.250
And I want this to have a dark background so I'm going to add the class of BGP dash dark and P Y dash

00:47.250 --> 00:48.820
three.

00:48.900 --> 00:49.340
OK.

00:49.350 --> 00:58.260
So it's 2 class Container and H 2 with the class of Section dash title.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.270
Let's say technical

01:02.400 --> 01:04.620
skills.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.390
And we're gonna do that our bottom line

01:09.360 --> 01:11.360
ups go under that need that.

01:11.390 --> 01:11.740
OK.

01:11.750 --> 01:22.020
So each progress bar we're gonna have an H four for each skill label so let's say photography do photography.

01:22.080 --> 01:30.240
COHEN And then under the H for let's do a class of progress.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.770
Now within this progress correct class we're gonna have a div and I'm actually gonna use inline style

01:36.770 --> 01:39.930
here because we need to set the width OK.

01:39.950 --> 01:46.460
So the style is gonna be basically how how full the progress bar is going to be I'm going to say for

01:46.460 --> 01:48.520
this it's gonna be 100 percent.

01:48.710 --> 01:51.540
So hundred percent full for photography.

01:51.740 --> 02:00.970
Now let's copy the H for along with the div here and let's do two three four five six.

02:01.190 --> 02:13.330
So the next one after photography let's do Adobe Photoshop and for that let's do 80 percent OK and then

02:13.330 --> 02:17.200
for this one let's do Adobe Illustrator

02:20.440 --> 02:25.930
and of course you can change these up I just basically just thought of these randomly.

02:25.930 --> 02:42.030
So it's to 70 percent and then let's do HD him now and see SS Let's do 100 percent for that let's do

02:42.960 --> 02:45.600
WordPress.

02:46.080 --> 02:55.890
So WordPress will say 80 percent and then let's do Magento which is an e-commerce platform and we'll

02:55.890 --> 02:58.080
do 70 percent.

02:58.770 --> 02:59.340
Okay.

02:59.340 --> 03:06.060
So if we were to take a look at this you'll see that we just have we have a dark background and we just

03:06.060 --> 03:07.570
have each label.

03:07.950 --> 03:15.900
So let's go into our main dot SPSS and it's up to you you could use the progress bar as I guess could

03:15.900 --> 03:18.810
be utility if you wanted to use them other places.

03:18.810 --> 03:25.410
But I'm just going to I don't plan on using them anywhere else so I'm just gonna put them in the about

03:25.410 --> 03:38.800
Dash B section so I'm going to go under the dash a here which ends right here say about B or label this

03:38.800 --> 03:39.550
one as well

03:44.550 --> 03:56.670
so we'll do Ampersand dash B and then we want the progress class and I'm going to set the overflow to

03:56.670 --> 04:07.980
hidden so that it stays contained and let's set a height of twenty pixels and then the background is

04:08.040 --> 04:13.050
the background is gonna be the medium color which is a gray.

04:13.080 --> 04:18.830
Now the div inside of it with the style with the percentage with the width with the percentage is going

04:18.830 --> 04:20.610
to be the main color.

04:20.610 --> 04:24.690
However the empty progress bar is going to be the medium color.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.140
OK.

04:25.140 --> 04:31.860
And then I just want rounded edges so I'm gonna do a border radius of five pixels and then let's do

04:31.860 --> 04:34.480
a margin bottom just to push them down.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.930
So we'll do zero point three ram.

04:36.980 --> 04:37.280
OK.

04:37.290 --> 04:39.600
Now we want to focus on the div inside.

04:39.600 --> 04:44.150
So we want to be within the progress style here and then add in our div.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.270
OK.

04:45.270 --> 04:52.200
So this number this is the one with the the style with the width we want the height of this to be 100

04:52.260 --> 04:52.970
percent.

04:53.070 --> 05:04.290
So it fills up you know vertically and I'm going to set the color to whites in case we put any text

05:04.290 --> 05:13.020
in there and let's do a text align center and then we want to set the background color which will actually

05:13.020 --> 05:15.780
be the color of the progress.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.230
So going to set that to the main color.

05:19.230 --> 05:19.570
All right.

05:19.590 --> 05:20.610
So we'll save that.

05:20.610 --> 05:24.360
We'll take a look and there we go.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.580
So that looks pretty good.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.900
Let's add a little more to the margin bottom.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.880
I'll do like six zero point six.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.440
Push it down a little more.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.720
And that's how we can create progress bars.

05:35.730 --> 05:41.460
So pretty easy you see these and you know frameworks like bootstrap and stuff but they're actually pretty

05:41.460 --> 05:43.950
easy to create on your own.

05:45.240 --> 05:50.330
So the next part of the about page is going to be the the logos.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.410
So it's work on that.

05:52.410 --> 06:00.750
We're gonna go back to about each team I'll close this up in that I don't think we have any more utilities

06:00.780 --> 06:03.260
but we'll come back to it if we do.

06:03.660 --> 06:14.730
So under this section we just did let's say section and this is gonna be section C logos.

06:14.730 --> 06:21.690
So basically like you know what logos of like the technologies that this person has worked with stuff

06:21.690 --> 06:22.710
like that you know.

06:23.700 --> 06:33.510
So we're gonna do section let's do an idea of about C and let's do a p y for class for padding and I

06:33.510 --> 06:36.890
want a big light background.

06:37.620 --> 06:38.080
Okay.

06:38.100 --> 06:46.690
And then we'll do a container and let's do a div with the class of about Dash logos which we're gonna

06:46.710 --> 06:49.910
use the grid for and then we just want our images.

06:49.920 --> 06:55.880
So this is gonna be image slash and then they're in their own folder called about logos.

06:56.070 --> 07:00.710
And we're gonna grab the invitro logo and then let's paste this down.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.630
Copy this down four times.

07:03.630 --> 07:07.480
Next one is gonna be WordPress.

07:07.590 --> 07:15.590
Next one is will commerce which is a WordPress plugin for e-commerce and then Magento.

07:16.980 --> 07:17.270
All right.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.210
So that's our logos and if we take a look at it they're just going to be giant.

07:21.210 --> 07:23.140
They're going to fill up the whole section.

07:23.220 --> 07:29.840
So let's go into our CSX and we want to work on see.

07:30.030 --> 07:32.970
So let's go outside of dash B

07:36.890 --> 07:46.140
so we'll do Ampersand dash C and let's grab the about logos.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.780
Let's use a grid

07:51.810 --> 07:56.470
and let's set the grid template columns.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.530
We have four.

07:57.540 --> 08:09.270
So we're gonna do a repeat four times one fraction and let's add a grid gap of 2 REM and then the image

08:09.440 --> 08:16.620
and take the image and set a width of 70 because one hundred is a little too too much.

08:16.620 --> 08:21.510
So we'll do width of 70 and if we take a look there we go it looks pretty clean.

08:22.410 --> 08:28.050
So next section is going to be the testimonials here.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.720
So let's add those.

08:30.720 --> 08:38.820
So go back and go to about say Section D

08:41.590 --> 08:42.880
testimonials

08:45.350 --> 08:46.230
to a boat.

08:46.230 --> 08:55.370
Dash D as far as classes I'm just going to do a p y dash for and to a container.

08:57.900 --> 09:03.700
I know this is very repetitive guys but it's good because you'll get it in your head.

09:03.700 --> 09:08.650
You know at least if you want to lay stuff out like this which is what I would recommend having just

09:08.890 --> 09:13.780
separate sections you know using utility classes and so on.

09:13.930 --> 09:25.290
So let's do H 2 with a class of Section dash title and testimonials and we'll do our bottom line

09:28.780 --> 09:32.360
and let's do a paragraph with the class of lead.

09:32.650 --> 09:34.240
And I also want this centered

09:36.800 --> 09:46.970
so let's say take a look at what my clients say.

09:46.970 --> 09:47.360
All right.

09:47.360 --> 09:54.380
And then underneath that we'll have our class of testimonials which will be a grid.

09:55.160 --> 10:03.770
So we'll have divs and just a paragraph we'll do like lower I'm 30 and underneath that underneath the

10:03.770 --> 10:13.730
paragraph I'm going to put a well on unordered list and we're gonna put an ally with an image.

10:13.730 --> 10:19.850
So this is gonna go image slash testimonials Slash.

10:19.850 --> 10:27.350
And then this is person 1 dot j peg guy and then I'm going to copy this div and we have four testimonials

10:27.360 --> 10:33.860
so two three four and we're just going to simply change the name in the image.

10:33.860 --> 10:40.270
So this will be person to person three person four.

10:40.310 --> 10:40.760
All right.

10:40.760 --> 10:45.430
Actually you know what I forgot is the names so we also want a list item with the names.

10:45.530 --> 10:48.050
So for the first one here let's say

10:50.450 --> 10:59.340
Sam Smith and we'll say location just say New York and let's go here.

10:59.710 --> 11:08.090
Let's say Sarah Williams a Michigan

11:13.270 --> 11:14.170
jail.

11:14.180 --> 11:14.960
Johnson

11:19.450 --> 11:20.140
London

11:23.080 --> 11:26.930
and to Steve.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.780
Steve Thompson

11:32.620 --> 11:34.310
and let's say Boston.

11:35.210 --> 11:41.430
OK so if we look at this without styling it doesn't look very good.

11:41.450 --> 11:50.500
So let's go ahead and jump into Maine dot SPSS and we're gonna start to work on the D sections so go

11:50.500 --> 11:51.450
right under here

11:56.120 --> 11:58.800
so Ampersand dash T.

11:59.090 --> 12:06.770
And we're gonna grab the testimonials Okay so testimonials is gonna be a grid

12:10.520 --> 12:16.190
and let's do a grid template columns again for columns

12:20.790 --> 12:24.680
grid gap zero point five REM.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.400
Now let's style the usual.

12:27.370 --> 12:29.310
So we want to make sure there's no bullets.

12:29.310 --> 12:33.040
So list style none.

12:33.060 --> 12:38.740
And let's do a margin top of one RAM just to push it down a little bit.

12:38.760 --> 12:48.530
I'm going to display it as flex and lets a line items to the center.

12:48.580 --> 12:49.000
OK.

12:49.020 --> 12:51.030
Now for the paragraph

12:53.960 --> 13:01.560
C for the paragraph inside testimonials I'm actually going to put a border around the whole thing so

13:01.560 --> 13:09.570
one pixel solid and let's use the medium color.

13:09.570 --> 13:19.960
Let's give it some rounded corners so do five pixels and then let's do some padding.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.910
Padding will do zero point five Ram.

13:23.280 --> 13:31.290
And then the image obviously the images are giant so we're gonna say with two fifty pixels we want these

13:31.290 --> 13:36.760
really small height 50 pixels.

13:36.760 --> 13:44.990
Let's do a border let's make him circles so we'll do border radius 50 percent and let's do it.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.130
Move over a little bit.

13:46.130 --> 13:49.630
So margin right we'll do zero point five.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.700
That's it.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.310
Take a look.

13:53.470 --> 13:56.070
Let's see that's not right.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.430
Looks like the grid messed up.

13:57.430 --> 13:59.330
What did they do.

14:02.870 --> 14:08.020
Oh I forgot got repeat.

14:08.030 --> 14:09.710
There we go.

14:09.710 --> 14:11.860
So I think this page looks pretty clean.

14:11.870 --> 14:13.310
Looks nice.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.130
So that's that's it for the about page.

14:16.130 --> 14:20.060
Next thing we're going to work on is the work page where we have all those.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.010
The transition effect and all that stuff.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.480
So there's some pretty crazy CSI s involved in that.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.310
So we're going to start on that in the next video.
