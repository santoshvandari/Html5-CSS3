WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:00.830
All right.

00:00.840 --> 00:06.150
So we've learned about each team mail including page structure tags syntax attributes and more.

00:06.270 --> 00:09.660
But H.M. by itself is very ugly as you've seen.

00:09.690 --> 00:15.870
So we need CSX are cascading style sheets to make our mark up or each team out look presentable.

00:15.870 --> 00:22.420
So the goal of this section is to look at the fundamental CSX properties for things like fonts colors

00:22.440 --> 00:24.990
alignment positioning etc..

00:24.990 --> 00:31.200
Now this section after this will we'll be creating an actual Web site project.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.720
But I didn't want to jump right into that right into a full project because I want you guys to really

00:36.720 --> 00:41.840
understand what's going on and understand what these properties are doing rather than just jump into

00:41.850 --> 00:47.880
a Web site project and have you copy the code and you know just follow along if you're really comfortable

00:47.880 --> 00:49.060
with basic CSX.

00:49.060 --> 00:50.430
Feel free to skip around.

00:50.730 --> 00:55.590
But even if you've worked with CSX before I think that they'll be things in this section that will still

00:55.590 --> 00:58.010
help you out that you can still learn.

00:58.050 --> 01:01.440
So here's a list of what will be going over in this section.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.570
I'm going to show you how to actually implement CSX as there's a few different ways we're going to look

01:06.570 --> 01:12.840
at basic selectors so that we can actually grab different elements whether it's by the tag name or the

01:12.840 --> 01:19.540
I.D. the class will look at fonts and colors and different properties different color types like hexadecimal

01:19.560 --> 01:26.280
our G.B. we're gonna look at backgrounds and borders including background colors background images box

01:26.280 --> 01:27.960
model and margin and padding.

01:27.980 --> 01:34.200
I'm going to look at what the box model is what exactly margin is where that spacing goes where the

01:34.200 --> 01:37.170
padding goes floating in alignment.

01:37.180 --> 01:37.460
OK.

01:37.470 --> 01:45.270
Now there are more more modern ways to align things on a page such as flex box and the grid system and

01:45.270 --> 01:47.140
we're gonna get into that later on.

01:47.220 --> 01:50.710
This section is all about just core basics RSS.

01:50.930 --> 01:51.260
OK.

01:51.270 --> 01:57.550
We're also going to be looking at the display properties so display inline display block inline block.

01:57.630 --> 02:03.480
We'll look at styling links and buttons creating menus such as a horizontal navigation menu as well

02:03.480 --> 02:05.850
as a vertical menu positioning.

02:05.850 --> 02:12.390
So relative positioning absolute fixed and so on form styling and then we're also going to be using

02:12.390 --> 02:16.680
the Google Chrome dev tools quite a bit to look at the age.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.860
Tim Allen CSX as well as the computed CSX and stuff like that.

02:23.120 --> 02:23.390
All right.

02:23.420 --> 02:28.490
So just like with the the last section we're gonna have a sandbox.

02:28.490 --> 02:34.150
So this will be the CSX sandbox where we're going to have a different file for different aspects of

02:34.220 --> 02:37.970
of the section different aspects of CSX.

02:38.120 --> 02:42.770
And you can keep this and use it if you ever need to go back to and these files will be included in

02:42.770 --> 02:44.390
the lecture downloads.

02:44.390 --> 02:48.350
And then after this section we're going to start putting everything together and we're going to build

02:48.620 --> 02:50.090
a simple hotel website.

02:50.740 --> 02:51.100
OK.

02:51.110 --> 02:56.690
So you and you can either use the CSF sandbox start of files or you can just create the files as you

02:56.690 --> 02:59.540
go like I'm gonna be doing in the video but that's it.

02:59.570 --> 03:00.830
Let's go ahead and get started.
