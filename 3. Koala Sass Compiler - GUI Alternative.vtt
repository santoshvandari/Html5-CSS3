00:00.330 --> 00:03.620
All right guys so this is kind of an aside from the rest of the section.

00:03.630 --> 00:07.920
I just want to give you a different option if you don't want to deal with node sass and deal with the

00:07.920 --> 00:10.580
terminal although I think it's easier than using this.

00:10.710 --> 00:16.470
This graphical program but nevertheless I want to give you the the options so if you go to koala dash

00:16.500 --> 00:23.790
app dot com you can download this program it's for Windows as well as MAC and it's a goofy program and

00:23.790 --> 00:28.130
it compiles both sass and less so I already have installed.

00:28.140 --> 00:33.300
So if you download install it just like any other piece of software and then open it up it'll look like

00:33.300 --> 00:34.140
this.

00:34.180 --> 00:34.560
OK.

00:34.560 --> 00:39.790
Now I also have this code open and I just created a test folder just to give you an example here.

00:39.930 --> 00:43.350
And I'm going to structure this just like we did in the last video.

00:43.350 --> 00:52.530
We'll have an SC SS folder where we'll have any SAS and then we'll create another folder called dist

00:53.320 --> 00:54.420
an inside disk.

00:54.420 --> 01:06.240
We're gonna have a folder called C Ss and most likely most likely an index each to email like that.

01:06.240 --> 01:06.560
All right.

01:06.570 --> 01:14.950
Now in koala I'm going to say plus sign to add a project and I'm going to choose from desktop test OK

01:14.980 --> 01:21.350
so we'll select that and see.

01:21.520 --> 01:28.900
OK so we don't have any SAS files so let's create in SPSS I'm going to create a new file called Main

01:28.900 --> 01:30.370
dot SPSS

01:32.680 --> 01:33.570
refresh that.

01:33.580 --> 01:41.860
So now it sees that we have a SAS file now by default when it compiles it'll put the CSX file in the

01:41.860 --> 01:48.280
same folder In SPSS we want to direct it to go into the C Ss in the dist.

01:48.280 --> 01:56.810
So we'll go to set output path and we're gonna choose dist CSX OK.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.800
Please select the CSX file.

02:00.280 --> 02:08.190
OK so we have to actually create the CSX file so we'll do main dot CSX like that and then let's do it

02:08.190 --> 02:17.620
again set whole put path to dist CSX main dot CSX replace.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.000
OK.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.940
So now this is this is running we can go ahead and minimize this.

02:23.970 --> 02:37.560
Now when I write some SAS in this main dot SPSS I'll do the same thing I'll do color red body and let's

02:37.560 --> 02:39.280
do background.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.920
So that's a color.

02:40.920 --> 02:47.520
And when I save that if I look in the main dot CSX you'll see that a comp. It also creates a source

02:47.520 --> 02:53.610
map I'm not going to go over that but you'll see there's a main dot CSX a map as well.

02:53.610 --> 02:58.380
So anytime we chant like if I change this actually we know what we'll do is we'll go to our index each

02:58.380 --> 03:03.120
to AML and let's include that CSX.

03:03.150 --> 03:08.040
So we're going to go CSX slash main dot CSX.

03:08.040 --> 03:08.430
All right.

03:08.470 --> 03:18.970
If we go ahead and open this with the live server actually live servers already running so let me set

03:25.030 --> 03:27.070
where is all right here.

03:27.110 --> 03:30.890
So I'm just going to stop live server from running.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.040
I'm going to stop node SAS and live server.

03:34.640 --> 03:34.900
OK.

03:34.940 --> 03:42.710
So now if I run live server from here this is the test folder where we use koala and if I go to my SAS

03:42.710 --> 03:48.560
and they change this to let's say green and save you'll see that it changes.

03:48.650 --> 03:48.940
All right.

03:48.950 --> 03:54.740
So if you're more comfortable using quality using the graphical interface then by all means you can

03:54.740 --> 03:55.310
do that.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.000
However we're going to stick to nodes SAS.

03:58.010 --> 03:58.250
All right.

03:58.250 --> 04:03.610
So just wanted to kind of add this as an aside to to give you another option.

04:03.620 --> 04:13.430
Also if you want to look into extensions if we search for SAS and V.S. code this right here live SAS

04:13.430 --> 04:18.140
compiler will actually compile your SAS for you as well.

04:18.380 --> 04:23.490
If you want to look into that there's just there's so many different programs you can use really.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.290
So whatever works for you.

04:25.310 --> 04:25.630
All right.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.100
So I'm going to stop this.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.630
I'm not going to use this anymore.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.480
This test folder that I created I just wanted to give you an example.

04:32.510 --> 04:37.170
In fact I'm going to just delete my project here and koala.

04:37.190 --> 04:37.460
All right.

04:37.460 --> 04:43.400
So in the next video we're going to jump back into our SAS sandbox and we'll start to look at some of

04:43.400 --> 04:44.090
the features.
