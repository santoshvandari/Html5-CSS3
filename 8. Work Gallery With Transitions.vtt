WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:05.880
All right guys so we finish the about page now we're going to move on to the work which is gonna be

00:06.990 --> 00:10.950
a set of images that will have a transition overlay.

00:10.950 --> 00:15.320
So we're gonna be using transition transform some other stuff as well.

00:15.450 --> 00:23.010
So let's jump in to V.S. code and what we're gonna do is copy everything from the about Dot HD him out

00:23.520 --> 00:31.110
and I'm gonna create a new file in the disk folder called Work dot each team L and then we'll go ahead

00:31.110 --> 00:41.250
and paste that in and let's change the title we'll just say my work and then we want to move the class

00:41.250 --> 00:46.970
of current from about to work OK.

00:46.980 --> 00:52.340
And then let's delete everything except for the footer.

00:52.350 --> 00:57.820
So all the sections you can get rid of all these and we'll just keep the footer.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.000
OK.

00:59.020 --> 01:05.310
Now if I save this and we go back and we click on work it should just look like this.

01:05.310 --> 01:05.660
All right.

01:05.670 --> 01:14.060
So the work page is it's basically just going to have one section which is gonna be the gallery.

01:14.250 --> 01:14.940
We could call it.

01:14.940 --> 01:20.250
So let's just say section A

01:22.800 --> 01:25.890
and let's say we'll just.

01:25.980 --> 01:30.360
Yeah we'll say gallery here OK.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.370
And we're just going to add a section.

01:32.370 --> 01:36.280
Let's give it an I.D. of work.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.560
Dash a.

01:39.720 --> 01:50.440
And actually I want to give it a class of text center and let's do P Y dash three.

01:51.140 --> 01:51.590
Okay.

01:51.610 --> 01:54.630
I'm gonna put it in the container.

01:54.630 --> 02:02.650
We're going to add our H two with a class section title and let's just say my work.

02:02.670 --> 02:11.310
And then underneath that we'll put a class of bottom dash line and underneath that will put a paragraph

02:11.310 --> 02:13.210
with the class of lead.

02:13.710 --> 02:22.790
And let's just say check out some of my projects.

02:23.350 --> 02:24.190
So we'll do that.

02:24.190 --> 02:27.430
And then underneath that we're gonna have a grid case.

02:27.440 --> 02:34.570
We're gonna have a class of items and then each item will be a div.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.880
And I'm gonna give it a class of item.

02:37.530 --> 02:38.070
Okay.

02:38.070 --> 02:43.840
And then inside there we'll have a class of item dash image.

02:44.350 --> 02:52.540
And let's put in our first image which is gonna be it's gonna have a source of image slash items slash

02:52.630 --> 02:55.400
item one dot P energy.

02:55.430 --> 03:00.910
OK so that's a first image that we want to go outside of the item image and create another did with

03:00.910 --> 03:05.090
the class of item dash text.

03:05.480 --> 03:05.930
OK.

03:05.950 --> 03:14.340
And inside here we're gonna have another div of the class of item dash text dash wrap.

03:15.070 --> 03:20.710
And we're gonna have a category and a title so the first is gonna be a paragraph with the class of item

03:20.740 --> 03:24.700
dash text dash category.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.480
And let's say design.

03:26.680 --> 03:32.140
And then under that we're gonna have an age to which which will have the title we're gonna say item

03:32.140 --> 03:39.090
dash text dash title and we'll say great gradients.

03:39.150 --> 03:39.390
OK.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.440
So these are just sample projects and they're just stock images.

03:44.500 --> 03:50.140
So what I'll do now is just copy the whole div with the class of item because we're gonna have quite

03:50.140 --> 03:54.130
a few of these nine to be exact.

03:54.130 --> 04:03.910
So let's do two three four five six seven eight nine and then we just want to change some of the info

04:03.910 --> 04:04.620
for some of the.

04:04.630 --> 04:13.360
So that's the first one the second one we're going to change the image to item two.

04:13.400 --> 04:23.680
I'm going to change the category two UI dash you ex and the title is going to be world experience and

04:23.680 --> 04:25.960
some of these titles might be a little weird.

04:26.080 --> 04:30.020
It's just kind of the first thing that came to mind when I saw the image.

04:30.130 --> 04:42.610
So this will be image 3 and the is going to be photography and photography and design and then the title

04:42.610 --> 04:48.390
for this is gonna be vanishing.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.060
So this one here.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.700
So we have 2 3.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.950
This will be item four.

04:54.510 --> 04:59.180
And let's see item four is gonna be category of design.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.420
And let's do gap.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.390
Say Gap Inc.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.540
And then let's see this is gonna be five.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.330
So five is gonna be the category of mobile.

05:14.070 --> 05:21.640
Let's say mobile UI design and we'll see a face.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.070
The experience

05:25.590 --> 05:38.610
OK so we have here we'll be Image 6 and category is gonna be design concept and can be busy curves

05:44.330 --> 05:48.800
get seven item seven is going to be photography

05:51.290 --> 05:53.990
and the title is gonna be Doc ponder

05:59.130 --> 06:00.870
OK so we get two more.

06:00.870 --> 06:08.130
This would be eight image eight and this is gonna be web applications

06:10.380 --> 06:11.880
and it's going to be called.

06:11.910 --> 06:13.480
It's just a restaurant app.

06:15.450 --> 06:25.950
So let's say rest rant app and then this final one here is gonna be Image 9 or item 9 and it's going

06:25.950 --> 06:37.810
to be let's say social network concept and we'll call this FriendFeed.

06:38.740 --> 06:39.050
OK.

06:39.090 --> 06:42.630
So if we take a look now it's going to look like this.

06:42.630 --> 06:45.110
Just two very large images small tax.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.610
So obviously we need to add some styling here.

06:48.610 --> 06:53.210
Now there's a lot of styling that goes into this.

06:53.220 --> 07:00.930
So what I want to do is just create its own sass file so I'll do that if I have a page or a part of

07:00.930 --> 07:06.480
an application that has just a ton of styling I'll put it in its own SAS file because in the end it

07:06.480 --> 07:07.060
all.

07:07.230 --> 07:11.570
It's all gonna just be compiled into our main CSX.

07:11.720 --> 07:21.990
So if you wanted to you could have another CSX file get compiled just leave off the underscore but I'm

07:21.990 --> 07:29.010
just gonna create a new SAS file in these SPSS folder called underscore and I'm going to call it item

07:29.190 --> 07:33.870
underscore grid dots SPSS.

07:33.870 --> 07:39.900
Now when you create a new a new partial you might want to restart your server with control C and then

07:39.930 --> 07:41.390
NPM runs SAS.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.840
If you don't see any changes that you make in your SAS files always try that because sometimes node

07:46.840 --> 07:53.540
SAS can just muck up a little bit and not you won't show you changes into your restart.

07:53.700 --> 08:03.150
So let's grab the items and we want to display is a grid case so all the items we want a three column

08:03.150 --> 08:03.470
grid.

08:03.480 --> 08:13.280
So we'll do grid dash template dash columns and let's do a repeat and we'll repeat three times one at

08:13.290 --> 08:15.040
far.

08:15.050 --> 08:15.360
All right.

08:15.360 --> 08:26.550
And then I'm just going to add a light box shadow here and we'll do 0 5 pixel or 10 pixel and then zero

08:26.580 --> 08:31.040
and then for the color I'm just going to do RGA which is red green blue Alpha.

08:31.620 --> 08:35.800
And let's just do a dark.

08:35.850 --> 08:40.060
So zero for RGA and then zero point three for the Alpha.

08:41.160 --> 08:47.010
Okay and if I save that and we take a look you'll see that now our images in all our items are in a

08:47.010 --> 08:48.640
grid.

08:48.750 --> 08:57.850
Now we're going to see I'm trying to think of how I should do this.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.470
Let's do the item.

09:00.470 --> 09:07.640
The core item styles first along with the hover effects and then we'll we'll move this stuff off the

09:07.640 --> 09:13.550
screen because ideally we don't want this to show at first until we hover over and then we want to have

09:13.550 --> 09:16.250
it basically come in with the overlay.

09:16.580 --> 09:17.970
So let's do that.

09:17.970 --> 09:18.430
I will.

09:18.470 --> 09:25.100
We'll take the item and everything else we do is gonna go in here because everything is prefixed with

09:25.130 --> 09:25.850
item.

09:26.060 --> 09:29.820
We have like item dash image item dash tax text wrap.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.170
So we can just use Ampersand dash and then whatever.

09:33.170 --> 09:36.490
So for the item itself we want to position relative.

09:36.490 --> 09:41.150
Ok everything is pretty much going to be positioned absolute inside of this item.

09:41.150 --> 09:48.790
So we want to position at this relative we want the background to be the main color.

09:49.110 --> 09:58.090
OK we'll set the overflow to hidden and then we want to add the overlay so we're gonna use Ampersand

09:58.830 --> 10:09.170
colon after we've created overlays like this before we need to put in content some quotes and let's

10:09.770 --> 10:17.960
position this absolute within its container or within the item and then we're going to do display

10:20.450 --> 10:25.650
block and for the background we're just going to inherit.

10:25.760 --> 10:32.900
So we get the main color and then the opacity I'm going to set just slightly translucent so we'll do

10:32.900 --> 10:34.300
zero point nine.

10:34.520 --> 10:40.090
And then let's say top from the top zero from the left zero.

10:40.100 --> 10:44.230
And then we want to go all the way across 100 percent.

10:44.450 --> 10:47.040
Again we're just creating the overlay here.

10:47.060 --> 10:53.900
So one hundred percent and then we want to add our transform.

10:54.230 --> 11:01.890
OK so transform is gonna be scale to translate X..

11:02.000 --> 11:10.850
So we want we want it off screen first so let's do negative 75 percent and then let's do translate

11:13.420 --> 11:17.880
y that's also going to be negative 75 percent.

11:17.930 --> 11:27.880
We're pushing it to the left and then we want rotate rotate is going to be negative 28 degrees.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.540
OK.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.580
And then we'll add our transition.

11:30.650 --> 11:36.140
So when we hover over it we're going to we're going to transition the transform property.

11:37.730 --> 11:44.410
OK transform we'll do it over three seconds and instead of using like ease or ease and now we're gonna

11:44.420 --> 11:51.620
use cubic BCA which allows us to kind of change the speed up and stuff like that.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.520
Are the curves.

11:53.520 --> 12:00.350
So we're gonna do zero zero point two one zero point three and one and you can mess around with it if

12:00.350 --> 12:07.900
you want but let's save that and we can see the overlay over the text here.

12:07.910 --> 12:10.560
But this is not going to be here afterwards.

12:10.570 --> 12:13.430
After we we get down to that part.

12:13.580 --> 12:19.590
So the overlay is not showing which is what we want because we want to bring it in when we hover.

12:19.610 --> 12:29.090
So let's go back and let's go outside of this after but still within the item and we want to bring in

12:29.840 --> 12:32.790
main color overlay.

12:32.810 --> 12:33.160
All right.

12:33.170 --> 12:38.180
So to do that we're gonna do at night at Ampersand hover.

12:38.900 --> 12:47.240
And then we also want to grab on to after which is where our overlay is and we're gonna do transform

12:50.090 --> 12:58.040
say scale to actually I'm just going to copy this because we're essentially doing the same thing except

12:58.310 --> 12:59.690
we want to bring it into view.

12:59.690 --> 13:06.190
So we want to do zero here instead of negative 75.

13:06.200 --> 13:06.530
All right.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.360
So let's save that and go back.

13:08.360 --> 13:12.430
And now you can see it's coming in all right.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.160
And if you mess with these values for the best yay.

13:15.160 --> 13:21.280
Like if I do one goal to change the curve so you can see that it actually changes the speed because

13:21.280 --> 13:27.930
it changes its place the curve up here because it's outsides negative 75 percent over.

13:28.090 --> 13:31.450
So zero point two I think is a good value.

13:31.480 --> 13:31.810
All right.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.620
Now we also want to scale the image a little bit on hover.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.800
Make it zoom in a little bit.

13:36.970 --> 13:42.110
So scale image on hover.

13:43.000 --> 13:51.400
So we're going to say Ampersand coal and hover and we want to grab on to the item dash image class so

13:51.400 --> 14:04.480
we can do Ampersand dash image and let's say opacity I'm sorry not opacity transform and wheel scale

14:05.350 --> 14:08.590
scale one point two on hover.

14:08.590 --> 14:17.150
So now if we go and we hover you can see that the image is scaling up and we're getting that overlay.

14:17.410 --> 14:23.710
Next thing is I want to bring the text in on hover although we haven't hit we haven't hidden the text

14:23.740 --> 14:25.680
yet but we will.

14:25.680 --> 14:32.060
So let's say Bring in text on hover.

14:32.230 --> 14:40.690
So we're gonna do Ampersand call and hover and then Ampersand dash text and we want to set the opacity

14:41.710 --> 14:45.270
to 1 because we're gonna set it to 0 by default.

14:45.370 --> 14:52.530
But when we hover we want it to set to 1 and we also want to bring it in with translate y.

14:52.530 --> 14:57.870
OK so translate Y and we wanted to just say zero which will be its resting position.

14:58.240 --> 14:58.610
All right.

14:58.890 --> 15:04.420
And right now it's not going to do anything because we haven't dealt with the default text basically

15:04.420 --> 15:08.380
where it should rest by default.

15:08.380 --> 15:12.480
So let's deal with the image first.

15:12.730 --> 15:20.350
So we're gonna add here Ampersand dash image which is the item dash image class.

15:20.740 --> 15:27.550
Set the height to auto set a transform.

15:27.800 --> 15:37.900
Actually I don't think we need to transform to display block because an image is is in line by default

15:38.350 --> 15:40.000
and then add a transition

15:43.030 --> 15:45.420
actually know what we do need to do this.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.580
We need to deal with the translate Z.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.910
So we want to add a transform for translate Z

15:54.460 --> 16:04.540
and set that to zero and then set the transition to that transform and let's say seven hundred and fifty

16:04.990 --> 16:11.930
milliseconds and we'll add the same cubic Bessie a value that we have up here.

16:12.130 --> 16:15.040
So just copy that.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.290
That should be good.

16:17.290 --> 16:17.560
All right.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.750
Now we also want to grab on to the image before pseudo selector.

16:21.760 --> 16:33.310
So we're gonna do Ampersand dash image before and set the content to just quotes and let's also set

16:33.310 --> 16:44.040
this to display block and then I'm going to add a padding top of 75 percent and an overflow of hidden.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.380
OK.

16:46.390 --> 16:50.830
So that should take care of the actual image container and this right here.

16:50.830 --> 16:51.460
Item image.

16:51.460 --> 16:56.200
Now for the actual image we want to position that absolute within it.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.060
Okay.

16:57.070 --> 17:13.350
So let's do Ampersand dash image and then I am G and position absolute top 0 left 0.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.980
Set the with two 100 percent height.

17:16.990 --> 17:23.590
We should be able to just set to auto and then line height will set to zero as well.

17:23.590 --> 17:27.040
OK so that takes care of the image.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.240
Not really any difference yet.

17:30.520 --> 17:35.920
Now for the text remember we want to hide that by default.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.470
We also need to move it.

17:37.520 --> 17:51.010
We need to we need to use transform translate to move it so let's go ahead and do the text.

17:51.010 --> 17:55.870
We're going to position this absolute.

17:55.960 --> 18:08.150
Let's set it to the top zero position and left zero position actually going gonna do zero on all sides.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.320
So top left bottom right.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.670
Zero.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.820
Now the opacity by default.

18:14.830 --> 18:21.730
I'm going to set to zero because we wanted to kind of fade in and then let's just make sure it's a line

18:21.730 --> 18:29.250
center and let's add a z index of 1 so that we make sure that it's on top and we can read it.

18:29.260 --> 18:31.250
We'll set the color to white.

18:32.020 --> 18:38.200
And as far as the transitions go we want to transition the opacity.

18:40.150 --> 18:41.410
Let's see actually you know what.

18:41.470 --> 18:42.380
Let's.

18:42.440 --> 18:42.620
Yeah.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.390
We'll just do opacity and then the transform.

18:47.290 --> 18:51.800
So opacity we'll do 500 milliseconds.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.430
And that same cubic busy a value

18:57.750 --> 19:04.440
so pace set in and then let's put a common here so we can add another one for transform which I actually

19:04.440 --> 19:05.620
haven't added yet.

19:06.150 --> 19:10.410
So transform 500 milliseconds.

19:10.410 --> 19:16.170
Same cubic BCA and then let's actually put the transform above it.

19:18.220 --> 19:18.920
OK.

19:19.080 --> 19:29.860
So transform we're just going to take translate why and set that as negative 20 percent by default.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.260
And then up here this is where we bring it in.

19:33.260 --> 19:39.420
So we set the opacity from 0 to 1 and then transform translate Y from negative 20 percent to zero.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.520
On hover.

19:41.630 --> 19:41.960
All right.

19:41.990 --> 19:49.310
So we also have the text wrap to deal with which goes around the title and the category.

19:49.310 --> 19:52.780
So let's add here.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.380
Text dash wrap.

19:57.740 --> 20:05.450
We want the width to be 100 percent and the position to be absolute

20:08.800 --> 20:15.860
K actually to put the absolute first position absolute with and then from the top.

20:15.870 --> 20:21.570
Let's move it down 50 percent and then we also want to translate Y negative 50.

20:21.570 --> 20:24.480
So translate I mean transform

20:27.980 --> 20:29.390
translate why.

20:29.720 --> 20:34.460
And we're gonna do negative 50 percent case.

20:34.470 --> 20:35.900
That's the Texas rap now.

20:36.120 --> 20:48.630
The Texas title it's just format that so we'll do Ampersand dash text dash title and I'm gonna set the

20:48.660 --> 20:49.980
font size

20:53.100 --> 21:05.460
font size for that to to ram for the title and then let's set the padding to 0 and it's 2 1 room and

21:05.460 --> 21:07.740
then margin.

21:07.740 --> 21:10.580
I'm just gonna do 5 pixel margin on the top.

21:12.100 --> 21:12.680
OK.

21:12.720 --> 21:17.010
And then the category 2 Dash.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.150
Text Dash.

21:19.290 --> 21:20.850
Category.

21:20.940 --> 21:25.970
I want that to be uppercase I'm going to do text transform uppercase.

21:25.980 --> 21:30.870
I also want it to be smaller so I'm gonna say font size or smaller than the title.

21:30.870 --> 21:39.720
So one point to rim and then the oh I'm going to set an opacity of zero point seven and clear the margin

21:40.320 --> 21:41.310
and that should do it.

21:41.550 --> 21:46.890
So let's save and go back.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.300
All right so something's not right.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.870
Because S.L. The Texas coming in really fast.

21:54.510 --> 21:56.160
It should actually come in after.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.550
And I think that's because I forgot the delay.

21:59.550 --> 21:59.800
Yeah.

21:59.820 --> 22:04.410
So we want to go to that where the text is and let's add a delay.

22:04.410 --> 22:11.230
So transition dash delay and let's do three hundred milliseconds.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.190
See if that works yeah.

22:14.330 --> 22:18.890
So it kind of comes in at the same time and if you want to if you want to mess with any of these values

22:18.890 --> 22:20.390
feel free.

22:20.390 --> 22:23.670
I know it's it's kind of advanced CSX.

22:23.690 --> 22:30.100
So if you want to mess with things and see exactly what does what feel free to do that.

22:30.260 --> 22:31.400
But I think that's good.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.740
I think that looks pretty good has a nice effect.

22:34.910 --> 22:36.940
So I think we're all set.

22:37.130 --> 22:42.610
So in the next video we're going to start on the contact page which is pretty simple.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.210
And then after that we'll move to making this responsive.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.950
And then finally we'll go ahead and deploy.
