WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:03.770
All right guys so now we're gonna get to the fun part which is the timeline.

00:03.780 --> 00:07.180
So let's go to our style dot CSX.

00:07.230 --> 00:16.050
And let's start off with the timeline you well so we'll see timeline you Al and it's not much.

00:16.200 --> 00:27.890
We just want to add the background it's a background which is going to be the primary color.

00:28.830 --> 00:35.850
OK so we'll save that and we see no difference there but I just want to add that and then padding.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.420
We're going to do 50 pixels top and bottom zero left and right.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.380
So we just move that down a little bit.

00:42.570 --> 00:54.630
Now for the list items to timeline you well ally and we want to set the list style to none.

00:54.960 --> 01:00.960
So make sure there's no bullet points and then we want to position this relative.

01:01.320 --> 01:01.770
OK.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.870
And the reason for that is we're gonna position some of the stuff inside of it.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.510
Absolute.

01:06.510 --> 01:08.370
So we want to make sure this is relative.

01:08.520 --> 01:14.740
And then we're gonna set the with two six pixels and we're gonna.

01:14.760 --> 01:22.230
And you'll see why in a little bit we're gonna set the margin 0 auto that pushes it into the middle

01:23.220 --> 01:31.030
and then we're going to say some give it some padding top of let's do 50 pixels.

01:31.110 --> 01:33.810
So for each list item and then the background

01:36.480 --> 01:39.340
we're gonna do white.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.300
OK.

01:41.400 --> 01:50.310
So what we've done here is we've created our line as you can see which is US has a width of six pixels.

01:50.310 --> 01:56.370
Now the boxes that are going to be coming off the sides are actually going to be the divs.

01:56.580 --> 01:56.880
OK.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.830
So if you look at our team all inside the ally we have the divs.

02:00.930 --> 02:03.240
So those are gonna be the the boxes.

02:03.240 --> 02:09.220
So that's why put six pixels for the ally itself because it's basically just the line.

02:09.210 --> 02:17.220
So let's go down here let's say boxes actually right here you know what we'll do is we'll say create

02:17.650 --> 02:18.240
line

02:20.740 --> 02:33.470
and let's see we're going to take time line you l l II div and let's say position relative.

02:34.870 --> 02:40.280
And from the bottom we're gonna say 0.

02:40.970 --> 02:41.300
OK.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.400
So we're going to start from zero from the bottom and then we're gonna set the width of the initial

02:45.400 --> 02:49.280
width of the boxes to 400 pixels.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.160
OK so now we have each div is four hundred pixels wide.

02:53.170 --> 03:00.520
And we need some padding so padding will say 1 Ram gives it some padding.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.580
We also want a background.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.510
So we'll do background and let's use our secondary color.

03:06.520 --> 03:13.060
So we'll say var and let's say dash dash secondary colour and save.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.890
And now we start to see our boxes forming.

03:17.110 --> 03:24.610
Now I want to add a transition on this because ultimately if we add our javascript we'll have some animation.

03:24.610 --> 03:38.620
So we're gonna add transition all let's say zero point five seconds and let's do ease ease in out

03:41.420 --> 03:46.250
OK so that's all divs now.

03:46.250 --> 03:51.050
The way I want to do this is the right side because remember we're gonna have him on the right and the

03:51.050 --> 03:57.050
left the right side is gonna be the odd in the left side will be the even gay.

03:57.050 --> 04:03.980
Now remember we have the end child selector and we can choose odd and even so let's go down here and

04:03.980 --> 04:07.970
let's say right side.

04:07.970 --> 04:19.100
So we're going to take the time line you l l II and we want to choose the n dash child and let's take

04:19.130 --> 04:25.840
all the odd and we want the div K we want to make sure we're targeting the divs divs is what have is

04:25.880 --> 04:30.860
where the box with the padding 400 pixels wide that's the div not the ally.

04:32.090 --> 04:38.880
And then here we're gonna say from the left we want this to be 40 pixels OK.

04:39.110 --> 04:44.630
And we'll save and notice that all the odds now are 40 pixels from the left.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.600
OK.

04:45.800 --> 04:54.110
So for the left side we'll go ahead and just copy this and let's say left side we're going to choose

04:54.110 --> 05:00.880
the Evens and we're gonna say from the left we want to go.

05:01.160 --> 05:06.020
Now remember though what we're saying is from the from the middle here which is the left we want to

05:06.020 --> 05:07.040
go this way.

05:07.040 --> 05:12.770
So we're gonna do negative four hundred and thirty four pixels and save.

05:12.890 --> 05:15.650
And that's going to bring it to the other side.

05:15.680 --> 05:21.620
Now I want to have the little dots here for each item in the timeline.

05:21.890 --> 05:26.810
So let's go down here and let's say dots and the dots.

05:26.810 --> 05:31.860
It's gonna be a timeline.

05:31.860 --> 05:35.150
You l ally and we're gonna say after.

05:35.150 --> 05:35.410
OK.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.890
So we're gonna use the after pseudo selector let's say.

05:38.900 --> 05:46.250
Content nothing in position absolutes.

05:46.490 --> 05:54.650
Remember we created this this line here with the ally so we're just saying after that we want to position

05:54.650 --> 06:06.600
this absolute we want to say from the left 50 percent and we're gonna set from the bottom zero and let's

06:06.600 --> 06:14.460
set the width so the width of the dot I'm going to say 25 pixels height also twenty five pixels.

06:14.460 --> 06:19.770
Now if I save that we're not going to see it yet because there's no background it's basically just just

06:20.130 --> 06:25.620
invisible so let's say background and I'm just going to inherit.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.850
So it should be.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.760
Well actually let's.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.820
What I want to do is I want it to be white to begin with.

06:32.820 --> 06:38.220
But once the sides are once they're brought in when we use the javascript I then want it to be filled

06:38.220 --> 06:38.980
with blue.

06:39.090 --> 06:43.980
But for now are the I'm sorry not blue with the primary color but for now let's just use the primary

06:43.980 --> 06:44.390
color.

06:44.940 --> 06:48.030
So see Dash Dash primary color.

06:48.210 --> 06:53.100
And if we save it's you can see what do we want.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.900
Now we want secondary I'm sorry.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.940
You can't see it.

06:57.390 --> 07:00.530
So it's a secondary color.

07:00.530 --> 07:01.450
All right.

07:01.620 --> 07:08.160
Now I want to move it over and I also want to make it into a circle so to move it over I'm gonna add

07:08.160 --> 07:15.450
a transform because remember we can do transform translate to move it let's say translate and we want

07:15.450 --> 07:17.510
to translate on the x axis.

07:17.670 --> 07:24.630
So we're gonna use translate X and we want to bring it over negative however much to the left we put

07:24.630 --> 07:27.030
it so we put it 50 percent to the left.

07:27.030 --> 07:33.450
So we want to say negative 50 percent and save and that will bring it right smack dab in the middle

07:33.960 --> 07:42.740
and then let's make it into a circle by just simply doing border radius 50 percent and save us.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.920
There we go.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.150
Okay.

07:44.180 --> 07:47.440
So now we have our dots.

07:47.610 --> 07:48.450
Let's see.

07:48.510 --> 07:54.880
So the next thing actually yeah that's good.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.350
So let's add a transition

07:58.960 --> 08:03.520
because like I said when we add the javascript I want it to be white at first and then.

08:03.550 --> 08:08.090
And then transition to to blue.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.840
When I went to certain classes added.

08:10.840 --> 08:16.720
That's basically what the javascript is gonna do it's going to add a certain class that will do certain

08:16.720 --> 08:18.330
things like position these.

08:18.370 --> 08:25.270
So slide them in and also change the color of this but for it to do it smoothly we need to add a transition.

08:25.270 --> 08:35.680
So let's transition the background zero point five seconds and ease in out OK so let's see the next

08:35.680 --> 08:40.990
thing I want to work on is the arrows because we want little arrows pointing to the DOT and the way

08:40.990 --> 08:43.860
that we can do that is manipulating the border.

08:43.870 --> 08:51.390
OK so let's go we'll go right right down here.

08:51.390 --> 08:56.030
Now we're going to hit the arrows are going to be on the div before.

08:56.030 --> 09:07.070
So we're gonna say timeline div before and we're gonna have to we'll have some styles that will pertain

09:07.070 --> 09:12.710
to just the left and just the right because obviously the arrows will be facing a different way depending

09:12.710 --> 09:19.330
on if it's on the left or right box but we're going to add some similar styles to all of the arrows

09:19.340 --> 09:27.290
so let's say content just blank quotes and then we want to position absolute.

09:27.830 --> 09:28.080
OK.

09:28.100 --> 09:34.990
So it's gonna be positioned absolute within the div and we're gonna say let's go from the bottom five

09:35.000 --> 09:36.380
pixels up.

09:36.800 --> 09:41.930
Because we want it to be we don't want it to be right at the bottom we want it to be like up five pixels

09:42.920 --> 09:53.090
and then we're gonna set the width to zero and the height to zero because the board the arrows are gonna

09:53.180 --> 09:54.620
come from the border.

09:54.640 --> 10:03.080
OK it's gonna be just from the border with and then let's set border style to solid.

10:03.530 --> 10:04.360
OK.

10:04.430 --> 10:11.340
Now the reason I'm just doing border style here is because whether it's on the left or the right it

10:11.350 --> 10:12.740
the style is gonna be solid.

10:12.740 --> 10:20.300
However the width and the color are gonna have different properties depending on if it's on the left

10:20.300 --> 10:21.280
or the right.

10:21.290 --> 10:28.130
So let's go down here actually I'll put a comment here and I'll say arrows say arrows base

10:31.410 --> 10:40.080
and let's go down here and let's say right arrows are right side arrows.

10:40.350 --> 10:46.290
And notice if I say we have these see these little dot dots or these little squares on each side.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.170
That's what we created with this.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.420
This whole style right here.

10:50.430 --> 10:54.350
If I get rid of that and save those those squares disappear.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.040
So we've created that.

10:56.040 --> 11:08.040
Now what I want to do is grab this the odd div because that's the right side and we'll paste that in.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.140
And remember the before selector is is how we're creating these arrows.

11:12.140 --> 11:18.000
So we want to do colon before and let's move it over so we'll see from the left.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.170
Negative 15 pixels by save that.

11:21.200 --> 11:30.420
You'll see that now this has moved over and the way that we can get this to basically shaped like like

11:30.450 --> 11:35.980
a point using CSF is with the border width and border color in certain spots.

11:35.970 --> 11:40.610
So border with we can do top right bottom left.

11:40.610 --> 11:51.090
So we're gonna do eight pixels top 16 pixels right eight pixels bottom and zero left top right bottom

11:51.090 --> 11:52.450
left.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.900
And if I save that you'll see that it just gets bigger really.

11:56.910 --> 12:00.540
Now we only want to color certain certain parts of it.

12:00.540 --> 12:05.110
We want to make transparent in certain parts we want to color.

12:05.110 --> 12:14.430
So let's do border dash color and we're gonna say transparent for the first value second is gonna be

12:14.430 --> 12:16.110
the secondary color.

12:16.110 --> 12:24.640
So var secondary color and then the next two will be transparent.

12:24.640 --> 12:24.980
All right.

12:24.990 --> 12:30.860
Now if I save that it turns into an arrow guy or that's it's shaped like an arrow.

12:31.050 --> 12:37.260
And this is done with with just the border it's a solid water we give it widths on each on each side

12:37.290 --> 12:45.540
and set it to transparent except one side and we get this point effect and if we move this if we add

12:45.540 --> 12:51.060
to it like let's say bottom 25 we can move the arrow up if we want but we want it right on par with

12:51.060 --> 12:51.930
the circle.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.900
So five pixels is good.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.860
It's basically right in the middle there.

12:56.070 --> 13:05.570
And for the other side for this over here let's just copy this pace set in and say left side arrows

13:05.580 --> 13:10.890
change this to even because that's the left and we're going to set the position to be from the right

13:10.890 --> 13:17.310
15 percent 15 pixels and then we need to change this stuff up because if I save this you'll see that

13:17.650 --> 13:19.990
it's it's pointing the wrong way.

13:20.010 --> 13:30.110
So we want to change the width to be eight pixels top 0 8 pixels and then sixteen at the end.

13:30.270 --> 13:30.960
All right.

13:31.080 --> 13:37.930
So if I saved that we can't even see it because we need to change this the color pattern up.

13:38.070 --> 13:43.890
Basically we want transparent for the first three and then have the secondary color as the last value

13:44.670 --> 13:46.520
like that and save.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.100
And there we go.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.760
So now we have our arrows.

13:49.520 --> 13:49.830
OK.

13:49.860 --> 13:55.320
So it's kind of cool that you can do this kind of stuff with CSX and it's a little it's a little difficult

13:55.320 --> 14:02.160
to understand but you know you'll you'll get the hang of it as you create stuff like this more and more

14:03.230 --> 14:04.140
so.

14:04.370 --> 14:05.720
And this is kind of advanced.

14:05.730 --> 14:13.400
This is this is pretty pretty advanced SS So we have our points this looks pretty good.

14:14.730 --> 14:20.040
I think what we need to do next is make it responsive because if I make this smaller you'll see it's

14:20.040 --> 14:25.530
basically just it's just stuck in that width no matter what I do.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.590
So in the next video we're going to add some media queries and we're good just going to change a couple

14:29.610 --> 14:31.980
things up depending on the screen size.
