WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:03.650
All right guys in this video we're gonna look at aligning elements.

00:03.660 --> 00:08.520
We're gonna look at aligning text and we're going to look at auto margin.

00:08.670 --> 00:12.480
So let's create a new file here called 0 7.

00:12.480 --> 00:22.480
And I'm just going to call this float underscore a line dot h t and now and throw in our tags here had

00:22.500 --> 00:25.290
body tags and we'll save float in a line

00:27.630 --> 00:29.010
style.

00:29.900 --> 00:30.390
OK.

00:30.390 --> 00:35.300
And all I want here is three divs with the class of box.

00:35.310 --> 00:39.590
But I want them to have separate I.D. so that we can target them separately as well.

00:39.600 --> 00:44.370
Now with Emmitt I don't think I showed you this if we want to add an I.D. and a class we can do like

00:44.370 --> 00:53.940
I.D. Box 1 class box OK we can do that and then I'm just gonna put an H three in here and I'm just going

00:53.940 --> 00:55.590
to say heading doesn't really matter.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.230
And then we'll do large 20.

00:59.670 --> 01:07.520
OK and we're going to copy this down two more times and just change the I.D. to two and then three.

01:07.560 --> 01:07.800
OK.

01:07.830 --> 01:10.830
So we'll save that and let's open this with live server

01:13.470 --> 01:14.150
OK.

01:14.220 --> 01:20.820
Now first thing I want to show you is how to center your your content or your layout because in in just

01:20.820 --> 01:23.730
about all cases every Web site you go to.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.710
It's in the center.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.940
It's not over to the to the left like this.

01:26.940 --> 01:32.520
Maybe in like the the 90s or early 2000s it was but now you see your stuff is gonna be in the middle.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.160
So to do that is pretty easy.

01:34.160 --> 01:40.560
We just need to have a container class or I.D. and or container element I should say.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.740
And then we need to add a width to it and set the margin to auto.

01:44.750 --> 01:45.050
OK.

01:45.060 --> 01:51.000
If we set the margin to auto it's going to add the same amount of margin on both sides pushing it into

01:51.000 --> 01:51.930
the middle.

01:51.930 --> 01:53.680
So let me show you what I mean.

01:53.760 --> 01:59.480
I'm going to wrap this in a class called container.

01:59.970 --> 02:00.320
OK.

02:00.330 --> 02:06.870
You'll see the class name container often container or wrap or wrapper and then we're gonna grab everything

02:06.870 --> 02:10.530
here and put it inside the container.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.740
And we just fix this up a little bit.

02:16.260 --> 02:16.620
All right.

02:16.630 --> 02:24.100
So up here in our CSX let's do container and let's set a width of.

02:24.130 --> 02:27.000
Now it's up to you how wide you want your layout to be.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.900
I'm going to do 960 which is kind of kind of narrow and then actually we'll just do that for now and

02:34.900 --> 02:42.910
if we go back to our ops if we go back to our content and I open up our chrome tools and take a look

02:43.600 --> 02:49.690
you'll see that looks we want to go to the container you'll see that the blue it ends at nine hundred

02:49.690 --> 02:51.040
and sixty pixels.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.950
That's 960 wide.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.870
Now to move it to the middle is very simple.

02:55.870 --> 03:04.450
All we have to do is add in margin auto if I save that we go back now you'll see it's in the middle.

03:04.640 --> 03:04.940
OK.

03:04.990 --> 03:08.320
And the orange part in the sides is the margin in.

03:08.370 --> 03:09.700
Notice it's the same.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.420
It's even on both sides.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.680
That's what happens if you do margin auto.

03:13.690 --> 03:19.480
Now if you want to move it down a little bit if you want margin on the top and bottom you could do something

03:19.480 --> 03:20.020
like this.

03:20.020 --> 03:23.010
You could say 30 pixels on top and bottom.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.780
Auto on the left and right.

03:24.910 --> 03:30.020
And now if I hover over it you'll see that there's 30 on the top and bottom.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.170
OK.

03:31.170 --> 03:35.760
Now there's there's an issue with using just width in this case.

03:35.820 --> 03:36.780
So let me show you that.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.360
It has to do with responsive design.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.310
You want to do all you can to make your site look decent on mobile devices and we're gonna get more

03:44.310 --> 03:45.020
into this later.

03:45.030 --> 03:51.080
But if I go down like this like if we were to view this on a mobile device you can't even read the text.

03:51.090 --> 03:54.590
You have this scroll bar which is just horrible.

03:54.630 --> 03:59.010
We want that all the text to display here so to fix that is very simple.

03:59.010 --> 04:02.830
All we have to do is go from with to using Macs with.

04:02.970 --> 04:07.230
So if I save that we go back now all the text is there.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.290
Regardless of the screen size.

04:09.390 --> 04:13.580
And then once I get to 960 it's going to it's going to stop.

04:13.590 --> 04:17.510
That's the boundary coaster you set a max width of 960.

04:17.550 --> 04:17.820
OK.

04:17.850 --> 04:21.900
So you should always use max width on your containers.

04:22.740 --> 04:23.000
OK.

04:23.040 --> 04:29.260
So next thing I'm going to do is just kind of style these boxes a little bit and the body I'm just going

04:29.260 --> 04:40.860
to throw in a body style of Let's do font du font family aerial Helvetica sans serif and then I'm just

04:40.860 --> 04:47.190
going to add a line height of one point four REM or M

04:50.250 --> 04:51.930
and let's see.

04:52.560 --> 05:06.020
Let's let's style the box class a little bit so for box we'll do background light gray and border one

05:06.030 --> 05:13.900
pixel solid dark gray padding 20 pixels.

05:14.070 --> 05:20.100
And let's do margin bottom 10 15 pixels.

05:20.100 --> 05:20.350
All right.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.440
Let's take a look at that.

05:22.470 --> 05:28.920
So all of our boxes now have 20 pixels padding they have the border the the background and some margin

05:28.920 --> 05:29.680
to push the.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.630
The other ones down.

05:31.440 --> 05:36.750
So before we get into floating I just want to look at the text align property and that's what text line

05:36.750 --> 05:40.780
is used for is just text it's not used to align boxes and stuff.

05:40.890 --> 05:44.310
So let's just target the paragraph in here.

05:44.310 --> 05:51.130
So I'm gonna say box and then we want to grab the paragraphs within the box.

05:51.600 --> 05:57.690
Let's put a comment here saying this is for the text align property.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.630
So by default it's aligned to the left.

06:00.630 --> 06:04.110
If I do that it's just going to stay how it is.

06:04.110 --> 06:11.590
But let's say we wanted that aligned to the right to its text align right.

06:11.610 --> 06:12.630
And if we look at that.

06:12.630 --> 06:15.510
Now the text is aligned to the right.

06:15.510 --> 06:20.940
If we want it to the center we could do center and it's just overwriting.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.380
I can leave these whatever the last one is that's going to overwrite the other ones.

06:25.380 --> 06:31.640
So now center case that was center in that text align center is used often.

06:31.740 --> 06:37.920
And I could put text align center on the div if I wanted this and if I wanted everything within it to

06:37.920 --> 06:41.160
be centered as well.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.960
And then we could also do justify

06:46.330 --> 06:53.950
so justify we'll just make the edges all even you can't really tell here because it's because there's

06:53.950 --> 06:54.790
not much tax.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.230
But if I make the smaller

06:59.170 --> 07:06.200
see how it's all even on the edge so that's justify I'm sure you guys have used justify and like Microsoft

07:06.200 --> 07:07.900
Word or something.

07:07.940 --> 07:08.270
All right.

07:08.300 --> 07:13.690
So now I want to talk about floating and I just want to explain something real quick.

07:13.690 --> 07:15.660
So I'm going to just do a search for age.

07:15.770 --> 07:16.650
I'll layout.

07:16.730 --> 07:20.100
Example go to images.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.210
Let's see.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.450
Let's look at this old bootstrap layout.

07:26.450 --> 07:30.680
So over here we have a sidebar and then we have a main area.

07:30.880 --> 07:37.610
OK so these are aligned horizontally and then inside the main area we have some boxes that are also

07:37.610 --> 07:39.110
aligned horizontally.

07:39.110 --> 07:43.470
Now we can do this with floats and that's what we're what we're working on right now.

07:43.580 --> 07:46.940
But that's not the the way that you should do it now.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.030
OK these days because now we have flex blocks that's built into CSX.

07:52.030 --> 07:59.030
We also have CSX grid and to use those we use the display property we can say display flex or display

07:59.060 --> 08:02.650
grid and then we have some other properties that are associated with it.

08:02.720 --> 08:09.680
And this is the the the way that you should do this stuff these days a couple of years ago we would

08:09.680 --> 08:16.070
have to use floats and floats are much more of a pain in the neck because you have to clear them.

08:16.070 --> 08:22.190
It's more of a pain dealing with responsive design dealing with you know mobile devices and stuff like

08:22.190 --> 08:22.860
that.

08:22.910 --> 08:30.090
So it's not ideal anymore but with that said I still want you guys to know how to use floats.

08:30.140 --> 08:35.990
In fact the project that we're going to do next at the hotel Web site we are going to use floats because

08:36.050 --> 08:38.570
I don't want to get into flax so the grid just yet.

08:39.200 --> 08:39.600
OK.

08:39.620 --> 08:44.210
So just keep that in mind just keep in mind that we're learning floats but it's not something that you're

08:44.210 --> 08:48.530
going to use use that much or that you should use that much.

08:49.190 --> 08:58.180
So let's say that we want to take Box 2 and 3 we want Box 2 to float to the left.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.500
Come to about here.

08:59.500 --> 09:05.180
So we want box 3 to be kind of a side bar more narrow box.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.190
So let's do that.

09:06.200 --> 09:17.860
Let's jump in and let's target Box 2 which has an idea of Box 2 and let's say float to the left.

09:17.900 --> 09:24.650
Now if we do just that it doesn't do much you'll see that it's kind of it's kind of put up right on

09:24.650 --> 09:31.310
top of box 3 but you want to add a width when you're floating something so let's say width and I could

09:31.310 --> 09:34.390
use pixels but it gets kind of messy.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.210
You're probably going to want to use percentages.

09:37.460 --> 09:42.660
Now the container that the boxes are in is nine hundred and sixty pixels.

09:42.790 --> 09:55.280
Max with so what we can do is let's use a percentage of 70 percent and then we'll take box 3 and let's

09:55.400 --> 10:01.840
float that to the right and let's say we want the width to be 30 percent.

10:02.010 --> 10:02.490
Okay.

10:02.540 --> 10:06.970
Because obviously 70 and 30 is 100 percent of its container.

10:07.220 --> 10:09.240
So let's see what that looks like we'll save it.

10:09.240 --> 10:14.990
We'll go back and we have an issue it's not it's not fitting.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.840
Now the reason for that is because we didn't set the board or box property.

10:18.980 --> 10:25.160
Remember in the last video I showed you that when you add padding which both of these have it adds to

10:25.160 --> 10:25.850
the width.

10:26.210 --> 10:26.660
OK.

10:26.660 --> 10:31.070
So this isn't another pain in the pain in the neck for for floating.

10:31.070 --> 10:32.080
It adds to the width.

10:32.090 --> 10:39.610
So we have to actually add a box sizing property on the asterisk.

10:39.730 --> 10:45.190
OK well we don't have to put it on the asterisk but I always do just to just because I want all elements

10:45.250 --> 10:47.140
I want this applied to everything.

10:48.010 --> 10:53.680
So let's say box sizing we want to set the border box.

10:53.680 --> 11:00.090
So once I do that it takes away that it doesn't add the padding to the actual widths.

11:00.250 --> 11:08.020
So now it fits but they're right on top of each other so what I would do in this situation is probably

11:08.020 --> 11:10.360
just lessen the percentage.

11:10.510 --> 11:19.490
So instead of seventy four a box to let's change it to 68 so it doesn't go all the way over and there

11:19.490 --> 11:20.510
we go.

11:20.510 --> 11:20.840
All right.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.380
Now this isn't going to look right.

11:22.460 --> 11:30.120
If we make this smaller but we're not going to get into that yet we're not going to get into responsiveness

11:30.150 --> 11:30.620
yet.

11:30.860 --> 11:36.750
Though the Web site the hotel Web site we build we will be using media queries and stuff to make it

11:36.750 --> 11:38.430
responsive.

11:38.430 --> 11:43.990
So I mean this is how we would do it before flexing and CSX grid came out.

11:44.130 --> 11:52.950
Now I just want to show you guys that if we add another div below this and we'll just call this box

11:53.060 --> 11:53.690
for.

11:55.770 --> 11:56.130
OK.

11:56.130 --> 12:01.140
So number two two and three offloaded and then box four is under it.

12:01.140 --> 12:03.320
So let's see what that looks like.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.310
Doesn't look right.

12:04.710 --> 12:07.560
So it's basically put behind it.

12:07.590 --> 12:13.330
It doesn't push it down under the floated elements because the floated elements have to be cleared.

12:13.350 --> 12:17.330
This is another pain in the neck when it comes to floating.

12:17.340 --> 12:25.260
So what we would do are one thing we could do is add a class a utility class and put it up here.

12:25.430 --> 12:32.160
I'll call it CLIA for clear and we'll set the clear property to both because we want to clear the left

12:32.160 --> 12:38.010
and right floats that we just created and then we would have to put it right under where the float is

12:38.010 --> 12:41.670
which is under 2 and 3 OK.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.440
So div class clear.

12:43.720 --> 12:48.580
Now if we go back box four is pushed down.

12:48.580 --> 12:52.410
OK so remember if you use floating you're gonna have to clear them.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.700
In most cases.

12:54.700 --> 13:00.400
Now another area that floating is used is in navigation bars a lot of time you'll see that the horizontal

13:00.400 --> 13:06.610
navigation is so in the next video we're gonna look at styling links and buttons and we're also going

13:06.610 --> 13:12.940
to look at creating a basic navigation bar where we float the the list items.

13:12.940 --> 13:13.180
All right.

13:13.180 --> 13:14.440
So I'll see you in the next video.
