00:00.210 --> 00:06.960
All right so in this video we're going to look at auto fit and min max which can make your grid kind

00:06.960 --> 00:08.250
of responsive.

00:08.250 --> 00:14.100
And it's good in certain situations not so good in some other situations it's great for like image gallery

00:14.100 --> 00:19.350
stuff like that but probably not so much for just regular Web site layout.

00:19.350 --> 00:29.720
So going to create a new file here called 0 4 underscore min max Don h t AML and generator.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.930
Each team out here

00:34.880 --> 00:35.870
OK.

00:35.970 --> 00:39.090
And just going to copy the styling for the item

00:42.460 --> 00:52.990
and paste that in here and then in the body let's put our parents in then we'll do item

00:56.880 --> 00:59.390
and let's do times four.

00:59.440 --> 00:59.690
OK.

00:59.710 --> 01:06.960
So if four grid items so let's set display grid on to our parent element here

01:09.740 --> 01:15.070
and then we're gonna set grid template columns.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.430
And I want to set it to repeat

01:20.070 --> 01:22.170
and I want to set in here.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.170
Auto fit.

01:23.220 --> 01:25.110
So auto dash fit.

01:25.110 --> 01:33.090
And then instead of just setting a width here I'm going to use min max which is a minimum and a maximum.

01:33.090 --> 01:39.270
So it's gonna take in those two things I'm going to say a minimum of 300 pixels a maximum of 1 FIA which

01:39.270 --> 01:41.330
is just the whole fraction.

01:41.430 --> 01:44.430
So let's save this and let's open this up

01:47.790 --> 01:48.060
OK.

01:48.090 --> 01:54.540
So immediately you can see that there's at this browser size we have two columns.

01:54.540 --> 01:54.870
Right.

01:54.870 --> 02:01.970
But as soon as I get to three hundred pixels which is our minimum it's going to just go to it.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.360
They're going to stack.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.690
So it's pretty responsive.

02:05.730 --> 02:10.770
And if I go bigger you'll see we'll have three until it hits they hit three hundred.

02:10.770 --> 02:14.070
Goes back goes to two bigger.

02:14.070 --> 02:29.120
Now if we were to make this to like 200 and let's add in a bunch of items here and save.

02:29.330 --> 02:33.100
So now you can see that it's it's pretty responsive.

02:33.100 --> 02:38.390
It stacks here but it's only good for certain types of content in my opinion.

02:38.410 --> 02:45.080
I don't use it for regular layout because if I wanted to have like let's just let's say I just wanted

02:45.080 --> 02:52.660
three boxes right where we have an icon some text it's like the features or whatever for the Web site.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.270
I don't ever want it to be like that.

02:56.810 --> 03:03.680
You know so I like to have more control over it in media queries so that I can set it to be either three

03:03.680 --> 03:05.290
or stack two like that.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.730
I don't want this midpoint here.

03:08.450 --> 03:12.960
So it's good for some some things but not so good for others.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.520
Image galleries things like that it's really good for.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.080
But I did want to just show you that.

03:19.430 --> 03:24.830
But in the next video before we get to I'm going to show you how to use media queries with the grid

03:24.830 --> 03:25.610
as well.

03:25.610 --> 03:31.180
But before we get to that I want to show you something called GRID template areas which are really nice

03:31.190 --> 03:37.960
they allow you to basically map out your content visually within your CSX and I'll show you what I mean

03:37.970 --> 03:38.870
in the next video.
