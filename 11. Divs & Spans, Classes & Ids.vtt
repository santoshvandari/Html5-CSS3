00:00.440 --> 00:05.310
All right guys in this video we're going to talk about divs and spans which are both HD female elements

00:05.310 --> 00:12.900
are tags as well as I.D. and class attributes which are used for semantics they used to kind of separate

00:12.900 --> 00:13.500
content.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.760
They're also used for CSF styling which you're going to talk about in the next section.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.700
So let's create a new file called 0 9 underscore and we'll just call it I.D. underscore.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.720
Class done H T.

00:26.340 --> 00:37.480
And we're going to put our structure our bar boilerplate in here and for our title we'll say div span

00:39.300 --> 00:42.840
I.D. in class.

00:42.840 --> 00:49.110
So we used divs before we used it to separate our kind of our labels and inputs in the form and where

00:49.110 --> 00:50.580
we talked about forms.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.460
So let's put a div in here and let's see.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.590
This is gonna be the header of our website.

00:55.590 --> 00:58.250
We have maybe an H1.

00:58.340 --> 01:04.230
My Web site or maybe you have an image a logo image and then we'll put a paragraph that says it like

01:04.230 --> 01:08.070
a some kind of slogan Just say a site about me.

01:08.130 --> 01:15.750
Now since everything in this div pertains to the header I'm going to give this an I.D. of header okay.

01:15.750 --> 01:20.970
Or maybe even main header because you could have multiple headers maybe you have an art you have articles

01:20.970 --> 01:26.000
on the page and you have headers for the articles so let's call this the main header All right.

01:26.010 --> 01:34.500
And then underneath that let's create a U L and let's give it some allies some list items and we'll

01:34.500 --> 01:38.610
put some links inside here and let's say this go.

01:38.610 --> 01:45.060
This is the home page link I'm going to copy this down twice will say this is the about link goes to

01:45.060 --> 01:47.910
the about page just goes to it's a contact.

01:47.910 --> 01:56.860
So it's this is a navigation menu so let's give this you all an idea of let's call it main now.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.680
You can call it whatever you want.

01:58.680 --> 02:06.120
Now let's say underneath the navigation we have an area that has some information about us or about

02:06.120 --> 02:07.920
our page or whatever it may be.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.590
So we'll have a div and let's give it an idea of about now.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.590
Here I'm going to show you a very very helpful image trick.

02:15.670 --> 02:23.040
OK so again it is installed with V.S. code and it allows us to do things faster so instead of typing

02:23.040 --> 02:30.240
out I d equals what we can do is we can say div and we can put a just a number sign which represents

02:30.240 --> 02:38.940
an I.D. the word about and then tab or enter and it puts it in for us and then to take it a step further

02:38.940 --> 02:46.410
if it's a div like we could do this with with an H1 we could give it an idea of about like that but

02:46.410 --> 02:51.750
if it's a div we don't even have to write the word div we can simply just put a number signed and then

02:51.780 --> 02:56.360
about and then hit tab or enter and it will give us a div with the idea of about.

02:56.850 --> 03:02.520
OK so nice little tip there and again you don't have to use it but it will make you write your hcm all

03:02.520 --> 03:03.990
much faster.

03:03.990 --> 03:09.750
So let's say in this about we have an h three which is a heading we'll say about and then maybe a paragraph

03:09.780 --> 03:13.510
with some text will just generate some dummy text here.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.060
Okay.

03:14.070 --> 03:21.180
And then maybe under that div we have let's say an area for for our contact info.

03:21.710 --> 03:21.990
Okay.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.630
And I know I haven't talked about spans or classes yet.

03:24.660 --> 03:25.920
I'll get to that in a minute.

03:26.340 --> 03:32.010
So let's create a div with the I.D. of contact.

03:32.010 --> 03:35.600
And in here we have another heading.

03:35.940 --> 03:40.710
Remember it's good it's good practice to not have more than one H one.

03:40.740 --> 03:47.130
I don't think so yeah we do have an H1 which is in the header so every div here is using an h three

03:47.130 --> 03:52.260
as a tile you could use an H2 and again you could use an H1 it's just good practice to just have one

03:52.260 --> 03:53.530
on the page.

03:53.910 --> 04:05.180
So let's put a well here we'll do some list items we'll put like address 50 Main Street Boston Mass

04:05.190 --> 04:07.980
let's put another list item with a phone

04:14.160 --> 04:17.950
and let's do another list item with an e-mail.

04:17.990 --> 04:23.030
Just save me at something cool dot com.

04:23.530 --> 04:23.860
OK.

04:23.870 --> 04:29.900
And then finally maybe we have a footer so we'll have a div here with actually we can just do I.D. footer

04:32.150 --> 04:42.530
and we'll have a paragraph and let's just say copyright 20 older 20 19 because it's the very end of

04:42.530 --> 04:44.480
2018 right now.

04:44.480 --> 04:44.870
All right.

04:44.890 --> 04:47.030
So let's save this and take a look.

04:47.150 --> 04:52.940
We'll open it with five server it's going to look very ugly because we have no CSX but it's structured

04:52.940 --> 04:55.090
in a very common way.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.330
So we have a header.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.150
We have the navigation.

04:58.190 --> 05:03.170
We have some some different sections about contact and then we have a footer at the bottom.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.730
And we used I.D. for all of these.

05:05.870 --> 05:11.960
Now when it comes to CSX week we can grab on to these ideas and we can styles these sections by their

05:11.960 --> 05:16.200
I.D. but we also have something called classes now.

05:16.220 --> 05:20.930
A lot of people get confused on when do I use an I.D. and when do I use a class.

05:20.930 --> 05:24.430
And the reason for that is there is no functional difference.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.510
Like they don't behave any differently.

05:26.540 --> 05:33.740
You can style them the same exact way but it's a good practice to always have your I.D. be individual

05:33.740 --> 05:38.360
meaning you're not going to have a main header I.D. anywhere else like you're not going to go down here

05:38.360 --> 05:44.380
and have a main header I.D. you're not going to have another section on the page that has an idea of

05:44.390 --> 05:45.760
about.

05:45.770 --> 05:50.600
So basically just one per I.D. now a class you can repeat.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.880
So let's say we wanted to style it like a border and a light gray background around the about and the

05:55.880 --> 05:59.850
contact area we might have a class called card.

05:59.860 --> 06:04.820
Actually I'm going to add a CSA style up here and don't worry if you don't know what any of this is

06:04.820 --> 06:06.350
I'm gonna do this later.

06:06.420 --> 06:11.960
I want to show you this later but I'm going to put a style that grabs on to the card class and we're

06:11.960 --> 06:17.600
going to add a class of card to both of the divs of about and contact.

06:17.660 --> 06:24.470
So whoops did that backwards one of two class equals card and then let's go down to the contact div

06:24.470 --> 06:30.390
right here and also give that a class of card and let's save.

06:30.440 --> 06:37.130
And now notice they both have the same styling so you can see the difference here I.D. their individual

06:37.130 --> 06:41.690
to that that section but classes you can repeat.

06:41.990 --> 06:44.420
So we can have as many cards as we want.

06:44.540 --> 06:50.750
If I wanted the header to have that same style excuse me I could give that a class of card as well.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.900
And it would get that styling.

06:52.900 --> 06:53.230
OK.

06:53.260 --> 06:57.130
So that's the biggest difference between I.D. and classes.

06:57.140 --> 06:59.240
Now some people I mean everyone's different.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.650
Some people don't even use I.D. they'll just use classes like instead of doing this.

07:03.650 --> 07:12.830
You might see something like this like class Main header and card both in this you know both classes.

07:12.830 --> 07:16.220
But I think that this is a better way to structure it.

07:16.820 --> 07:17.200
OK.

07:17.210 --> 07:21.610
But you'll come to find your own way of doing things.

07:21.800 --> 07:28.340
But generally the most important thing is not to repeat I.D. on the same page at least.

07:28.400 --> 07:28.730
All right.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.490
So next let's talk about divs and spans.

07:31.490 --> 07:37.880
We've used quite a bit of divs here to separate out our content and the main difference between a div

07:37.880 --> 07:40.850
and a span as a device is a block level element.

07:40.850 --> 07:43.310
It pushes the next thing down.

07:43.310 --> 07:51.680
So let's say I had a style for let's let's let's do a class called enhance and let's say we want the

07:51.680 --> 08:03.320
color to be yellow and we want the background color to be black.

08:03.700 --> 08:09.590
And this is CSX I'm going to go over this all in the next section and let's say we wanted to add it

08:09.590 --> 08:12.200
to a piece of text in this paragraph.

08:12.260 --> 08:24.700
So if we use a div we say div class equals enhance and let's wrap this div let's put it like right here

08:25.120 --> 08:32.950
and let's save it we get that styling but it knocks it on to the next it next line it basically goes

08:32.950 --> 08:38.860
in between you know this line and this line this is a case where we want to use a span because a span

08:38.860 --> 08:40.190
is an inline elements.

08:40.210 --> 08:41.700
So let's grab this.

08:41.710 --> 08:48.160
I'll highlight this div and do control D to grab the next one and just change them both to a span.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.870
Guys save it.

08:49.870 --> 08:54.040
And now notice that it's not it's not block level.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.520
It just stays in its place and we can still add that styling.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.550
So that's the difference between the span and a div.

09:00.700 --> 09:05.140
For the most part you're going to be using divs but when you need it to be inline you want to use a

09:05.140 --> 09:06.390
span.

09:06.460 --> 09:12.670
Now each team of five when it was released it came out with something called semantic tags to better

09:13.210 --> 09:15.130
to better layout our sections.

09:15.130 --> 09:20.320
So for instance there's a header tag which we could use instead of having to use an I.D. we could use

09:20.320 --> 09:21.890
the actual header tag.

09:21.980 --> 09:26.980
There is something called the NAV tag we could use for navigation there's section tags for stuff like

09:26.980 --> 09:29.830
this and we're gonna go over that soon.

09:30.130 --> 09:36.970
But in the next video I want to just quickly cover entities OK which are little symbols we can use in

09:36.990 --> 09:43.400
H T L for instance this copy right down here if we want to put a copyright symbol we can do Amber stamp

09:43.660 --> 09:50.620
copy semicolon and if I go ahead and save that and now you see down here it actually gives us a little

09:50.620 --> 09:51.710
copyright symbol.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.220
So I want to talk a little bit about that in the next section before we move on to HCM all five semantic

09:57.220 --> 09:57.790
tags.
