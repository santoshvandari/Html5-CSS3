WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:00.690
All right.

00:00.690 --> 00:03.960
In this video we're gonna look at entities and symbols.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.060
Real quick OK.

00:05.090 --> 00:15.890
So we're going to create a new file called Ten underscore and let's just call this entities dot HMO.

00:16.110 --> 00:16.480
All right.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.870
So we're going to put in our boilerplate say entities

00:25.090 --> 00:28.740
so the first thing I want to show you is a non breaking space.

00:28.740 --> 00:33.630
I'm to put a comment here and say non breaking space.

00:33.880 --> 00:46.000
So if I put a paragraph and I say Hello my name is Brad and I run this and live server or you open your

00:46.000 --> 00:50.130
web page so we get to sell a paragraph that says Hello my name is Brad.

00:50.140 --> 00:53.170
Let's say that I wanted to put a bunch of whitespace.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.920
OK so where you see no text.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.620
It's called whitespace.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.990
Let's say I wanted to put a bunch of it in between is and Brad.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.520
Like if I go over here and I just put a bunch of spaces like that and they save.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.640
There's no difference.

01:06.670 --> 01:07.180
OK.

01:07.270 --> 01:12.730
It doesn't in the browser is not going to see these spaces and render it like that.

01:12.850 --> 01:17.920
If you wanted to do that for some reason and there's not too many cases where you would do this but

01:17.920 --> 01:22.360
if you did you could use a non breaking space which is an HD female entity.

01:22.420 --> 01:27.860
So it's actually going to be Ampersand and B S P semicolon.

01:28.060 --> 01:33.750
Remember the in the last video at the end they showed you the copyright entity which was Ampersand copy

01:33.760 --> 01:41.260
semicolon and you can look these up on W3 schools that you can find a list of all the entities symbols

01:41.260 --> 01:42.420
and stuff like that.

01:42.610 --> 01:46.370
But let's go ahead and save this and you see how it knocked it over a little bit.

01:46.420 --> 01:53.710
If I go ahead and grab this again and put another one let's put a couple of them and save it we'll keep

01:53.710 --> 01:54.840
pushing it over.

01:54.850 --> 02:00.470
So if you ever need to push a line over like that you can use a non braking space.

02:00.580 --> 02:08.860
So next thing I'm going to show you is how we can use or how we should use angle brackets so greater

02:08.860 --> 02:12.120
than and less than obviously they're used in each team all tags.

02:12.130 --> 02:22.060
But what if we wanted to actually put them on the in the each team page and say greater than and less

02:22.060 --> 02:22.730
than.

02:23.740 --> 02:29.830
So put a paragraph and let's just say 5 2 maybe this was a page that had some math equations or something

02:30.310 --> 02:33.770
we'll say five is greater than two.

02:33.970 --> 02:40.900
If we save that it does actually show up on the page but in some browsers it can actually get confused

02:40.900 --> 02:44.860
because it looks like the beginning or actually the end of each team.

02:44.860 --> 02:45.490
I'll tag.

02:45.910 --> 02:51.580
So usually when you do this if you want to actually put an angle bracket displayed on the page you would

02:51.580 --> 03:01.810
you've used the entity Ampersand G T semicolon K GTI is greater than so let's save this and you'll see

03:01.810 --> 03:04.730
that it renders the same thing OK.

03:04.840 --> 03:14.260
If we wanted to do a less than let's actually we'll just comp copy this down and let's say let's do

03:14.260 --> 03:24.100
one is less than two we could use LTE by save that you'll see one is less than two.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.760
There's also numbers for entities as well.

03:27.760 --> 03:33.970
So I'm actually going to copy this down again the greater then and instead of doing G T I'm gonna do.

03:33.970 --> 03:43.810
Number sixty two and save and notice said it again gives me the greater than so the number for less

03:43.810 --> 03:46.450
than is actually sixty.

03:46.470 --> 03:53.560
So we would do Ampersand number sine 60 and save and you'll see it gives us the same thing.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.000
Now most cases you're going to use the greater than and less than.

03:57.010 --> 04:01.070
But I just wanted to show you that you can actually use the number.

04:01.070 --> 04:01.380
OK.

04:01.420 --> 04:05.620
We already saw the copyright but I'm going to put it in here anyways.

04:05.630 --> 04:09.770
So we're going to do Ampersand copy semicolon.

04:09.790 --> 04:12.610
This is the one that I use frequently.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.620
We also have the trademark.

04:14.800 --> 04:20.360
So it's two Ampersand and this is our e.g.

04:20.360 --> 04:26.470
And if we save that and you can see it gives all not the trademark the little R if we want to do like

04:26.470 --> 04:27.670
currency stuff.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.370
Dollar Signs pound stuff like that

04:34.160 --> 04:35.410
we can do.

04:35.780 --> 04:36.960
Let's see for

04:39.950 --> 04:43.000
obviously dollar signs we can use that the actual key.

04:43.010 --> 04:50.780
But let's say we wanted to sense we could do Ampersand sent save and it gives us a little sense sine

04:53.230 --> 04:53.590
OK.

04:53.600 --> 05:05.600
We can also do for working with foreign currencies like pound ups can do pound we can do yen we can

05:05.600 --> 05:16.360
do Euro save that we get all those different symbols we can even do use suits like card suits OK.

05:16.730 --> 05:17.990
Such as spades.

05:17.990 --> 05:22.360
So if I wanted to do Ampersand spades semicolon.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.210
There we go.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.820
And of course we have the other three.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.630
So if we want

05:30.060 --> 05:30.930
clubs

05:33.630 --> 05:42.810
hearts and diamonds is actually D I A M S guy so yeah I mean you're probably not going to use these

05:42.810 --> 05:45.710
very much but I did just want to show you guys it.

05:46.020 --> 05:54.770
Also if you want to display something in like computer code font you can use the code tag.

05:54.990 --> 05:59.270
So let's say computer code.

05:59.310 --> 06:08.190
So it's a code which is a tag and let's say we wanted to display p p p p code now in P P you start your

06:08.190 --> 06:10.140
code with this right here.

06:10.140 --> 06:18.670
This is an opening p p tag and this is a closing p p tag and you could put like Echo string Hello.

06:18.710 --> 06:24.270
I don't expect you to understand any of this but let's say we wanted to display this on the page and

06:24.270 --> 06:32.240
we wanted it to look like code so we would replace this with the entity of less than.

06:32.310 --> 06:43.790
So we'll do Ampersand LTE semicolon and then let's replace this with Ampersand GMT semicolon and we'll

06:43.790 --> 06:44.540
save that.

06:44.540 --> 06:48.260
And now down here notice that it actually looks like code.

06:48.260 --> 06:54.260
OK so if you wanted to put a code snippet into your page maybe it was it's a programming site or something

06:54.260 --> 06:54.800
like that.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.020
That's how you would do it.

06:57.020 --> 07:00.480
There's also a tag called K BD for keyboard.

07:00.620 --> 07:10.310
So if we wanted to put like a paragraph and we were giving instructions to say save the file by pressing

07:10.940 --> 07:13.210
and let's say we were telling them how to save a file.

07:13.220 --> 07:25.310
So control s we could put a K BD tag and we could put in C T R L plus s we'll do like that and save

07:25.850 --> 07:32.120
and now save the file by pressing control s and notice the control s is kind of it's in that computer

07:32.120 --> 07:33.000
code font.

07:33.590 --> 07:33.970
OK.

07:34.010 --> 07:39.140
So it's again not these these aren't things that you're going to use all the time but it's something

07:39.140 --> 07:40.490
that is good to know.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.590
And again if you want to look at all of the different the different entities and symbols available in

07:45.590 --> 07:50.870
each HTML you can go to the W three schools it's a like I said it's a great reference site.

07:50.960 --> 07:51.220
All right.

07:51.230 --> 07:55.490
So in the next video we're going to start to look at each team of five semantic tags.
