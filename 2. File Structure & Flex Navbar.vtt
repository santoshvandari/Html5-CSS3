WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:06.280
All right guys so we're gonna get started here and I basically just have an edge ledger underscore Web

00:06.290 --> 00:11.220
site folder that's completely empty and I open that within V.S. code so you're going to want to do the

00:11.220 --> 00:11.980
same.

00:12.030 --> 00:16.500
And then in this lecture you'll find an image resources zip file.

00:16.530 --> 00:23.910
So you want to unzip that and we just want to grab all the images that are here and we'll copy these

00:23.970 --> 00:26.660
into our edu ledger Web site folder.

00:26.670 --> 00:31.760
We want to create a folder called EMG and we want to paste those images in there.

00:32.960 --> 00:33.660
OK.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.050
And then if we go back into v s code you can see we have our images to work with.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.140
So let's create our structure here.

00:40.170 --> 00:45.060
Obviously going to need an index study each time l and this is the only aged female page we need because

00:45.060 --> 00:46.790
this is a single page Web site.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.600
Everything is on one page.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.810
We just have different areas that the menus go to.

00:51.850 --> 00:52.710
And this is common.

00:52.710 --> 00:58.290
I'm sure you guys have seen this before and it's actually easier because you don't need as much copy

00:58.380 --> 01:05.100
as much markup our content I should say you know if you just want one section to have a paragraph and

01:05.100 --> 01:11.730
some list items that's fine and you don't have to think of all this this content and people don't want

01:11.820 --> 01:18.270
a ton of content to have to read through they want everything just very simple and easy to read and

01:18.270 --> 01:19.110
understand.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.810
And I think having single page Web sites like this really really helps with that rather than than them

01:24.810 --> 01:27.080
having to search through all these pages.

01:27.240 --> 01:33.260
So let's put in our boilerplate here actually let's create the rest of the file structure.

01:33.510 --> 01:40.890
We need to see assess folder and in CSX we're gonna have a style dot CSX file.

01:40.890 --> 01:50.220
We're also going to have a mobile dot CSX file and we're gonna have a wide screen DOD CSX because I

01:50.220 --> 01:56.540
want to style the icons differently depending on on if it's on a wide screen.

01:57.150 --> 02:04.110
And then we're also gonna have a J S folder so javascript and we're gonna have a file inside there called

02:04.110 --> 02:10.530
Main dot J S which is gonna have the javascript for the Google map as well as the smooth scrolling because

02:10.530 --> 02:15.990
we can't do that when we actually need a little bit of JavaScript for that for the smooth scrolling

02:15.990 --> 02:22.470
we're gonna use something called J query which is a javascript library to do all sorts of things.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.330
Animation is is pretty much the only thing that I would use J query for these days.

02:27.330 --> 02:31.110
So something like this smooth scrolling is much much easier with J.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.590
Query.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.950
But we'll get to that later.

02:33.950 --> 02:39.910
So let's close all these up except for index and then we're going to continue on here.

02:39.930 --> 02:49.200
So for the title I'm just going to say edge ledger financial and let's put a pipe character and then

02:49.200 --> 02:55.350
we'll see accounting and investment.

02:55.620 --> 02:55.960
OK.

02:55.980 --> 03:03.480
Let's put all all of our CSX files so we'll say link tab or link enter and I'm going to say CSX slash

03:03.660 --> 03:12.870
style CSX and I'm going to copy this so can shift option or shift Ault on windows down twice this first

03:12.870 --> 03:21.630
one I'm going to change to mobile the second one I'm going to change to widescreen and we need to add

03:21.840 --> 03:32.280
media queries or media attributes for mobile and widescreen so let's say screen and we want a max width

03:32.400 --> 03:42.000
of seven sixty 68 pixels OK and then for widescreen let's do media equals screen.

03:42.030 --> 03:49.230
And this time we want to do men with and we want eleven hundred pixels so this will only kick in when

03:49.230 --> 03:53.060
the screen is bigger than eleven hundred pixels.

03:53.060 --> 03:53.490
OK.

03:53.490 --> 04:00.510
And we're also going to be using font awesome so let's head over to font awesome dot com and click this

04:00.510 --> 04:08.370
button here and grab the link so that we can incorporate icons will pace set in there and our head should

04:08.370 --> 04:09.620
be all set.

04:09.690 --> 04:15.840
So let's go ahead and open this up and we're going to going to have a blank page we have an ad in anything

04:15.840 --> 04:22.860
yet so going to start with the nav bar obviously we're going to go top to bottom and I put the nav bar

04:22.920 --> 04:28.470
outside of the showcase outside of this header with the idea of showcase and the reason for that is

04:28.470 --> 04:35.860
we're using a sticky nav bar and if we put it inside of the showcase or in the header here what's going

04:35.860 --> 04:41.880
to happen is once we reached the bottom it's going to disappear because it's basically stuck inside

04:41.880 --> 04:42.970
of its parent.

04:43.020 --> 04:44.940
So we don't want this to have a parent.

04:44.970 --> 04:48.550
So we want to put the nav bar above the showcase.

04:48.570 --> 04:48.990
OK.

04:49.020 --> 05:00.870
So let's go into body and let's do nav tag and we want to put an I.D. nav bar and we want inside here

05:00.870 --> 05:04.300
in H1 we'll give it a class of logo.

05:04.620 --> 05:08.500
And inside this H1 as you can see we have an icon.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.860
And then these are both going to be green.

05:10.860 --> 05:13.180
So we need a special class for that.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.920
So let's do let's say span we'll give.

05:18.030 --> 05:26.930
Give this a class of text primary and inside here we want to put our icon.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.710
So I with the class of F.A. yes.

05:29.880 --> 05:36.300
And then another class this particular icon is F A Dash book dash open.

05:36.910 --> 05:41.800
And we want the word after the icon we want the word edge.

05:41.800 --> 05:48.090
And then outside of the span we want the word ledger because on the edge should be green.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.290
So ledger.

05:50.740 --> 05:51.050
OK.

05:51.070 --> 05:55.970
So that's our logo and then under that we want our navigation which will be a well.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.260
And we want for list items with links.

05:59.260 --> 06:05.020
So we'll say list item we'll use Emmet here so curly braces we can put in the content which will be

06:05.020 --> 06:07.090
in a tag.

06:07.090 --> 06:09.560
We'll just have this go nowhere.

06:10.090 --> 06:14.930
And then we want four of them so we're gonna say times four and hit enter.

06:15.010 --> 06:15.600
Okay.

06:15.610 --> 06:19.480
And if you don't like Emmett if you don't want to do that stuff you can simply type it all out but I

06:19.480 --> 06:25.540
think Emmett makes it much more faster much more efficient and you'll get you'll get used to it.

06:26.530 --> 06:30.960
So home let's do what.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.780
Who and contact and then for the links here.

06:36.790 --> 06:42.040
They're just going to go to the I.D. home the idea of what.

06:42.070 --> 06:42.300
OK.

06:42.340 --> 06:47.610
So these will be sections who and contact.

06:47.710 --> 06:47.970
All right.

06:47.980 --> 06:51.770
Now home as you can see it brings us all the way up to the top.

06:51.790 --> 06:56.140
So I'm going to put the idea of home on the body.

06:56.140 --> 06:56.900
OK.

06:57.130 --> 07:02.790
And this will work even without javascript but it will just kind of click down and it will just go right

07:02.860 --> 07:06.330
down it's not going to have this smooth effect to do that we're using the J.

07:06.340 --> 07:07.650
Query intimate method.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.990
But for now it's just going to kind of click to that area.

07:12.040 --> 07:12.400
All right.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.030
So let's see we have our NAV bar.

07:16.060 --> 07:22.600
So I'm just going to put a comment here and seeing nav bar and if we take a look it's going to look

07:22.600 --> 07:23.800
horrible.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.570
What I want to do is work on each.

07:26.620 --> 07:32.380
Basically each component at a time so we'll do the nav bar then we'll move on to the showcase then this

07:32.380 --> 07:37.210
area this area and so on and we want to style it as we go.

07:37.270 --> 07:46.470
So let's jump into style dot CSX and we'll most likely do the responsiveness after after we get them

07:46.510 --> 07:49.150
the main style down.

07:49.150 --> 07:58.480
So in style dot CSX let's first ad like our our base styles our core our core things that that don't

07:58.480 --> 08:00.670
pertain to specific classes and stuff.

08:00.670 --> 08:03.980
So body lengths asterisk.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.750
We want to add a reset but first thing we want to do is implement our font.

08:07.750 --> 08:13.690
I'm actually using that were a bottle font which is not you know a regular font.

08:13.710 --> 08:24.540
So we're gonna go to Google our fonts dot google and let's search for rubato and right here I'm going

08:24.540 --> 08:30.910
to click the plus sign go down here click on that and I'm actually going to import want to choose this

08:30.910 --> 08:36.070
and I'm going to imported into our CSX file so you can either do that or you can bring it in as a link

08:36.070 --> 08:40.180
tag and your each team Al but I'm just going to go ahead and just do that.

08:40.890 --> 08:41.290
OK.

08:41.290 --> 08:45.340
And once I do that I should be able to use font family rubato.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.460
So we're for our body.

08:48.460 --> 08:51.480
Let's add in that.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.920
Now I'm going to add a little CSX reset here.

08:54.970 --> 09:01.060
We want to make sure our box sizing is border box.

09:01.060 --> 09:08.710
And then I want to just zero out all the margin and padding case or resetting the margin and padding

09:08.710 --> 09:12.760
for everything and then links.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.640
So for lengths I'm just going to remove the underline.

09:15.640 --> 09:23.590
So text decoration underline and I want to add a little bit of margin back to the paragraphs because

09:23.590 --> 09:27.280
remember when we add our reset it takes away margin and padding from everything.

09:27.670 --> 09:35.100
So four paragraphs let's do zero point seven five REM on the top and bottom and zero left and right.

09:37.270 --> 09:37.690
OK.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.370
So take a look.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.710
Looks like this.

09:42.040 --> 09:48.430
Let's see so next thing I want to do is let's take care of the text primary class.

09:48.430 --> 09:51.900
Remember we wrapped this in text primary.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.560
Let's put a space after that icon.

09:54.700 --> 09:59.610
So right here we'll put a space and that pushes that over a bit.

09:59.660 --> 10:13.540
So going to go right here and I'm going to say utility classes do text primary and for text primary

10:13.530 --> 10:23.590
you're gonna do a color and the primary color is going to be nine three C B 5 2 which is gonna be that

10:23.590 --> 10:25.060
green color.

10:25.140 --> 10:25.480
All right.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.250
And if I save that we take a look.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.320
Now that's green.

10:29.320 --> 10:29.770
OK.

10:29.770 --> 10:34.050
Now let's let's deal with the nav bar.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.810
So let's see.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.990
Go right under here.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.510
Let's say nav bar and the nav bar itself.

10:45.390 --> 10:47.400
Let's let's add a background

10:50.140 --> 10:56.410
of 3 3 3 actually save it's going to look like that.

10:56.410 --> 10:56.680
You know what.

10:56.740 --> 11:01.270
Let's kind of what I want to show both at the same time.

11:01.280 --> 11:08.120
So I'm going to just shrink this down a little bit that should be good.

11:08.140 --> 11:08.410
OK.

11:08.440 --> 11:15.290
So we have a background and any anything that's not a link we can add color white.

11:15.320 --> 11:15.630
OK.

11:15.640 --> 11:21.090
So if I say this it's not going to change the the links because that's that's a separate color.

11:21.460 --> 11:24.160
And I want to position this sticky.

11:24.160 --> 11:34.060
So I'm actually going to do position for the first value here and let's say sticky and we want to say

11:34.090 --> 11:35.120
top zero.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.660
That's where we want it to stick.

11:37.690 --> 11:41.300
So when we scroll it should stick to the top.

11:41.350 --> 11:48.900
Now I want this to be flex because we want the logo over here we want the menu over here.

11:48.910 --> 11:53.090
Now remember the hotel site we used floats and we're not using floats anymore.

11:53.290 --> 12:00.910
So let's add right here a display of flex and watch what happens as soon as I do that.

12:00.910 --> 12:07.780
Now they're aligned this way not the list items but the whatever is the the child of the nav bar which

12:07.780 --> 12:16.570
if we look is the H1 and the well this dish to children k what what is in those children is irrelevant.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.510
These are the flexi items the NAV and the well.

12:19.510 --> 12:23.570
So those get basically floated horizontally.

12:23.570 --> 12:26.710
Now I want this over here.

12:26.710 --> 12:27.040
Right.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.450
So remember the justified content property.

12:31.570 --> 12:34.500
What that does is it aligns things horizontally.

12:34.540 --> 12:41.290
So I'm going to use space between because I want I want the space to be in between both of the Flex

12:41.290 --> 12:42.110
items.

12:42.130 --> 12:47.600
So let's go ahead and just choose it right here space between and save.

12:47.650 --> 12:50.900
And now that gets pushed over to the side.

12:51.590 --> 12:54.170
So let's see.

12:54.610 --> 13:01.960
Another thing I want to do here is I want to add a z index so a z index is going to it's basically the

13:01.960 --> 13:02.640
position.

13:02.650 --> 13:09.550
I know we went went over this back a while ago but it's the higher the number the closer to the screen

13:09.550 --> 13:11.380
the closer to you it is.

13:11.410 --> 13:14.060
And I want this to always be on top of everything.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.210
When we scroll down so I'm going to put a z index of 1 and that should do it unless we set something

13:19.210 --> 13:24.120
else to z index of 2 or higher than this should go over everything else.

13:24.180 --> 13:24.510
OK.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.310
Hopefully that makes sense.

13:26.650 --> 13:30.840
And then I'm also going to add just a padding value of one room.

13:31.270 --> 13:37.210
So in this case one room is 16 pixels because we haven't touched the eight the root each team.

13:37.210 --> 13:41.010
Font size and that's what REMS are based on.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.730
Next thing we want to do is the well

13:45.380 --> 13:52.470
OK now the U.S. is also going to be flex because we want these to align horizontally so let's say display.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.700
OK.

13:54.830 --> 13:58.900
Remember no more floats display flex save.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.490
There we go.

14:00.490 --> 14:11.920
And then I'm also going to I'm going to do a line items to the center OK so that kind of puts both of

14:11.950 --> 14:14.930
the logo in this at the same level here.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.950
And let's take away the bullet points.

14:18.080 --> 14:23.160
So list I want to do list style.

14:23.480 --> 14:23.990
None.

14:25.360 --> 14:25.760
OK.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.720
And then we also want to deal with the links.

14:28.970 --> 14:38.780
So let's do now Navarre well ally a new color white.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.670
OK so we have our White links.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.340
Wait a minute why is it still underline.

14:45.370 --> 14:48.070
Oh I did text decoration underline there should be none.

14:50.980 --> 14:51.250
All right.

14:51.310 --> 14:57.430
So next thing we want to do is separate them because we don't want them right on top of each other so

14:57.430 --> 15:02.800
let's add a padding here and let's just do zero point seventy five.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.060
Right.

15:03.090 --> 15:09.530
Notice some using REM for for most most things paintings and stuff like that.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.010
And then let's save that see what we get.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.030
Good.

15:13.090 --> 15:22.370
Now I'm also going to add a margin on the one to do a margin on the left and right.

15:23.080 --> 15:29.880
So margin let's do zero and then zero point to five REM on the left and right.

15:30.310 --> 15:34.840
Now when I hover over these I want to have kind of a green box around it.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.890
So let's do the hover state.

15:38.110 --> 15:49.330
So now bar you well ally a colon and hover and let's do a background in the background is going to be

15:49.330 --> 15:53.600
the same green that we have right here.

15:53.650 --> 16:00.640
The Texas primary so we'll copy that paste that in and save that.

16:00.670 --> 16:03.500
Let's check it out OK good.

16:03.500 --> 16:09.410
Now I do want the corners to be a little rounded so let's do a border radius and this is all stuff that

16:09.410 --> 16:10.500
we've done so.

16:10.780 --> 16:15.020
We'll do five pixels and we have a little round on the corners.

16:15.020 --> 16:15.280
All right.

16:15.290 --> 16:15.800
So that's it.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.190
That's our NAV bar.

16:17.270 --> 16:22.960
And as you can see it's it's much cleaner using flex than using floats and stuff like that.

16:22.970 --> 16:28.400
And you know you'll see that you'll realize that as we move along especially with the boxes and stuff

16:28.400 --> 16:29.420
like that.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.370
Also aligning in the showcase.

16:32.480 --> 16:36.230
So that's what we're gonna do next is the whole header showcase area.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.730
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
