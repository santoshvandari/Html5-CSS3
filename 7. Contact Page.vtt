WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:05.730
OK so now that we've done the home page the about page now we just have the contact.

00:05.730 --> 00:09.570
So I'm going to copy everything on the about page.

00:09.570 --> 00:14.730
It makes sense to call it to copy the about page because it has the nav bar without the showcase and

00:14.730 --> 00:15.540
stuff like that.

00:16.260 --> 00:24.300
So let's jump over to contact each Tim Allen paste that in and let's just change the title to contact

00:25.260 --> 00:35.370
and let's take the class of current off of a boat and let's put that on to contact and then we can get

00:35.370 --> 00:37.200
rid of everything down to the footer

00:40.850 --> 00:44.650
and we'll save and then we'll go to contact and we should see this.

00:44.690 --> 00:51.440
Now one thing that we need to grab is the font awesome link to this font awesome CSX because we are

00:51.440 --> 00:53.450
actually using icons here.

00:53.450 --> 00:59.420
So from the index page in the head I'm going to grab the link for font.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.300
Awesome.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.250
So this right here I'm going to copy that and bring that over to contact.

01:04.250 --> 01:09.730
Put it right above our link to our style sheet and that should be good.

01:09.730 --> 01:16.050
So now let's go down below the header and we'll start to create our form

01:20.070 --> 01:28.180
so let's put in our section and we'll give it an idea of contact dash form and I'm gonna give it our

01:28.180 --> 01:37.420
padding class our p y dash 3 class and let's add a container push everything to the middle let's put

01:37.420 --> 01:38.410
in each one.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.270
Let's see user Clark L heading class.

01:41.270 --> 01:43.990
Do you see how will you keep reusing these classes.

01:43.990 --> 01:50.690
That's that's the idea of a class an I.D. is more for identifying a section like we're doing here.

01:50.770 --> 01:54.150
So hopefully that that starts to really make sense.

01:54.160 --> 02:03.010
So this this H one is going to say contact us but I want the word contact to be that that primary colors

02:03.010 --> 02:04.640
so we're gonna put in a s.

02:04.690 --> 02:17.890
We want to put in a span with a class of text dash primary and we just want to put this span on the

02:17.890 --> 02:25.480
other side of contact and then below the each one we're gonna put a paragraph and just say please fill

02:25.480 --> 02:33.490
out the form below to contact us.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.160
Okay.

02:34.180 --> 02:39.730
We'll save that should look like that and then we're gonna create our form.

02:41.290 --> 02:44.400
So the form will will go somewhere.

02:44.410 --> 02:51.250
I mean we'll just put like process dot peach P for now for the action but it's not we're not actually

02:51.250 --> 02:58.150
handling the submission right now and for the fields we're gonna have a name email and message and I'm

02:58.150 --> 03:04.990
gonna wrap the label and input inside of a div with the class of form dash group.

03:04.990 --> 03:11.800
So inside the form group will have the label the four attribute will say name name.

03:12.130 --> 03:13.960
And then under that we'll have an input.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.420
So let's give it a type of text and the name will be.

03:18.420 --> 03:26.120
Name I.D. will also be name and then we'll have another form group actually we can probably just use

03:26.440 --> 03:34.360
copy this div paste that in and this will be the email.

03:34.570 --> 03:38.530
So for email we'll change the type to email

03:41.930 --> 03:48.670
that's in the I.D. and then we'll have one more which is going to be the message.

03:49.580 --> 03:58.900
So paste that in and change this to message the message.

03:59.250 --> 04:02.410
Take this another little little trick here.

04:02.420 --> 04:06.630
Keyboard shortcut if you want to highlight something without the mouse you can hold shift.

04:06.790 --> 04:11.620
I'll hit the back arrow and you see how it's highlight if I go the other way in a line highlight it

04:11.630 --> 04:19.070
so I can highlight name and then do a controlled D to choose the next version of name and I'm going

04:19.070 --> 04:20.480
to change it to message

04:23.480 --> 04:31.550
except we want this to be a text area not an input so I'll just take this and change it to text area

04:32.210 --> 04:38.440
and text areas have a closing tag so we just need to add that in there right.

04:38.490 --> 04:39.930
So that looks good.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.630
And then we just want our submit button.

04:41.640 --> 04:47.770
So we're gonna go below this last div here with is still within the form we'll do button.

04:47.910 --> 04:52.200
And remember our class of B T N We want to use that on this button.

04:52.680 --> 05:05.510
And we just want to give it a type as well of submit type equals submit and say submit for the text.

05:05.670 --> 05:06.140
OK.

05:06.210 --> 05:08.130
Go ahead and save take a look.

05:08.130 --> 05:12.960
Looks absolutely horrible so we have to add our styling.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.750
So let's go to our style dot CSX.

05:15.750 --> 05:25.020
I'm actually going to make this smaller so we can see it and we'll go below our testimonials and say

05:25.050 --> 05:27.820
contact form.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.770
So an idea of contact form.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.250
That's our section.

05:32.250 --> 05:38.490
And then let's style the form group OK which wraps the label and the input and I just want to do a margin

05:38.490 --> 05:40.900
bottom just to push each field down.

05:41.220 --> 05:43.410
So we'll do 20 pixels.

05:43.410 --> 05:54.000
All right then we'll do the label so contact dash form label and we want that to be display block so

05:54.000 --> 05:56.430
that it pushes on to the next line.

05:56.430 --> 06:00.590
And then let's do a margin bottom of five pixels.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.950
OK we'll save that.

06:01.950 --> 06:02.820
Good.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.020
Now let's do the input and the text area.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.460
So contact form input.

06:08.460 --> 06:16.690
We also want to do contact form text area.

06:16.700 --> 06:23.880
And let's put this on a separate line just to make it a little neater and we want a width of 100 percent.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.150
We want it to go all the way across.

06:26.190 --> 06:27.000
Save that.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.050
Let's add some padding to make them thicker so we'll do 10 pixels on all sides.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.680
Let's do a border.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.260
Notice the message has a thicker or darker border.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.060
We want them all to match.

06:40.110 --> 06:42.070
So we'll do one pixel.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.130
Let's do DDD and solid and save.

06:47.190 --> 06:50.930
Now the text area I actually want to be a little bigger.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.070
I want increased the height.

06:52.080 --> 07:03.060
So I'm going to take just the text area selector here and just set a height of 200 pixels like that.

07:03.060 --> 07:09.700
And notice that our button looks just like the other links that have the B10 class.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.080
All right.

07:10.080 --> 07:17.870
Now I want to show you guys that you see when I when I click on one of these it has the blue outline

07:17.880 --> 07:20.810
we can actually change that color if we want.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.940
This is something I haven't gone over yet.

07:22.950 --> 07:26.450
So these are these are the focus states of these inputs.

07:26.640 --> 07:35.430
So I'm going to actually copy this that the input and the text area selectors and I'm just going to

07:35.430 --> 07:38.100
add on this pseudo selector of focus.

07:38.270 --> 07:39.040
OK.

07:39.210 --> 07:47.650
So we want to say in the focus state we want to set the outline to none.

07:48.150 --> 07:50.070
And we want to set the border

07:52.520 --> 07:54.860
color to that.

07:54.930 --> 08:02.310
F Right here F seven c z 0 8 a and save.

08:02.970 --> 08:07.790
And now when I hope when I click on one of these you'll see that the outline is that same color.

08:07.880 --> 08:11.210
So we can target that focus state in style and how we want.

08:13.010 --> 08:15.140
So the next part we have is the.

08:16.040 --> 08:16.460
The.

08:16.490 --> 08:22.460
This part right here with the icons and this is going to resemble the boxes on the home page you're

08:22.460 --> 08:24.890
actually going to use the box class.

08:24.890 --> 08:31.640
So let's head over to contact h t AML and let's create our section so we'll call this we'll give it

08:31.640 --> 08:34.640
an idea of contact dash info

08:37.760 --> 08:46.040
and I want this to have a dark background so we're actually going to also add the class it's two class

08:46.070 --> 08:56.840
equals B G dash dark and inside the section we'll put our container and let's add our boxes.

08:56.840 --> 09:03.390
Now I'm actually going to copy from the index each team l let's grab those those boxes.

09:03.560 --> 09:11.030
So it's C under features we have the div class box so we have three of these let's grab all three all

09:11.030 --> 09:18.920
these divs and we'll bring them to the contact paste right in there and we're gonna change great location

09:18.920 --> 09:21.110
to just location.

09:21.110 --> 09:28.820
We're gonna keep the same same icon the hotel icon but I want to change this paragraph to be the actual

09:28.820 --> 09:36.270
location so we'll say 50 Main Street Boston Mass.

09:36.490 --> 09:42.400
And the next one here I'm gonna change the the icon to a phone icon which is gonna be F.A. phone and

09:42.400 --> 09:49.900
you can look up all these classes at Fort Awesome dot com we're gonna change this to phone our phone

09:49.900 --> 10:04.250
number and inside the paragraph let's put a fake phone number say 6 1 7 5 5 5 just do all fives and

10:04.270 --> 10:06.520
then this last one I want to be the e-mail.

10:06.550 --> 10:15.520
So there's actually an icon called F.A. dash envelope and we'll change this h three to email address

10:17.530 --> 10:27.580
and then let's just add in a fake email address here we'll do like a front desk at lots to hotel B T

10:27.580 --> 10:30.800
dot co.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.220
All right so we'll save that.

10:33.380 --> 10:40.180
Now these boxes actually have the the BJP lite BJP primary we want to get rid of those because we want

10:40.180 --> 10:43.270
it to be just dark behind all of them.

10:43.340 --> 10:48.740
So I'm going to get rid of that BJP primary get rid of that class and make sure you keep the box class

10:49.610 --> 10:51.210
and save.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.400
And there we go.

10:52.430 --> 10:55.060
Let's make this a little bigger make sure it looks OK.

10:58.030 --> 11:00.460
And that's our contact page.

11:00.590 --> 11:01.910
So that's it guys.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.830
Our project is complete.

11:03.830 --> 11:09.860
We have our little hotel Web site and hopefully you learned quite a bit from this project especially

11:09.860 --> 11:12.160
if you're brand new to each team Allan CSF.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.630
Hopefully you can see now how things come together because I know what the sandbox sections.

11:17.630 --> 11:22.120
We just kind of looked at at individual parts of each team and to assess.

11:22.130 --> 11:25.420
And now we're actually putting it all together to build something.

11:25.430 --> 11:31.430
So what I'd like to start to do now that you know the basics you know each team on the basics of CSX.

11:31.430 --> 11:37.790
I'd like to get into more modern parts of CSX like media queries for Responsive design the grid system

11:37.790 --> 11:44.170
flex blocks later on we'll get into like transitions and animation and then of course deploying a Web

11:44.170 --> 11:44.630
site.

11:44.630 --> 11:47.040
So we have quite a quite a bit to do.

11:47.060 --> 11:47.350
All right.

11:47.360 --> 11:53.600
So that's it though at least now you know h team Al you know the basics of CSX and we're ready to dive

11:53.600 --> 11:54.020
in more.
