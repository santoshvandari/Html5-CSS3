00:00.380 --> 00:06.480
All right guys so we have enough under our belt to start to create really cool projects and this Web

00:06.480 --> 00:11.340
site that we're going to be building is called Edge ledger which is the name of a fictional company

00:11.580 --> 00:17.430
which is basically an accounting firm or an investment firm something like that.

00:17.430 --> 00:23.250
It's obviously not a real company and like these aren't real clients I have my logo here but these are

00:23.250 --> 00:25.060
just stock logos that I found.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.770
And I'll have a folder in this lecture called Image Resources.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.000
You can get all the images but we're going to do quite a bit here.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.790
We're going to use flex for everything.

00:34.800 --> 00:39.720
So just to align all this stuff in the middle we'll use flex we'll use flex on the menus.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.190
We're going to use it to align these three boxes these to the contact.

00:44.190 --> 00:50.700
It is a single page and it has a menu so if we click like what it will take us to what we do who takes

00:50.700 --> 00:54.200
us to who we are contact will take us down to the contact.

00:54.240 --> 01:00.240
Now this is not a javascript course but we will be implementing a little bit of JavaScript code here

01:00.960 --> 01:05.760
specifically for the map because you do need to use a little bit of JavaScript to get a Google map to

01:05.760 --> 01:08.940
display as well as the smooth scrolling here.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.230
So we're gonna use a little bit of J query for that.

01:12.810 --> 01:19.830
I do have a course called Modern javascript from the beginning but this particular course is not focused

01:19.830 --> 01:24.050
on javascript so we're not going to get deep into the code or anything like that.

01:24.150 --> 01:29.340
But I did want to make it look pretty cool and have the scrolling effect and so on.

01:29.340 --> 01:34.260
You might also notice the overlay on the image this image is actually much brighter than this.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.870
We're going to UCSF to give a dark overlay so that the text is very readable.

01:39.870 --> 01:40.160
All right.

01:40.170 --> 01:42.530
We probably won't do that to the end.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.000
Another thing we're going to do is make this menu sticky.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.290
Notice how it always stays at the top no matter where we are.

01:48.390 --> 01:53.970
That way if we click who you know we can easily go up to what without having to go back up.

01:53.970 --> 01:55.770
That would kind of defeat the purpose.

01:55.800 --> 02:00.350
So we're going to implement this sticky menu you can see it has a little bit of transparency.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.940
So it's I think it's a pretty good looking site.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.640
We'll also be using font awesome.

02:04.670 --> 02:09.850
I'm going to show you how we can style them to have these background circles and so on.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.960
So it's it's quite a large project relative to the hotel Web site.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.920
It's also going to be responsive.

02:15.990 --> 02:23.190
So we're going to have media queries and once we get to Mobile size you can see the menu changes and

02:23.250 --> 02:25.720
if we go down here these are all stacked.

02:25.860 --> 02:31.140
We get rid of the image of the people we stack the map underneath the form.

02:31.140 --> 02:38.250
So it looks good on mobile devices and if I want to check on an actual device we'll use our chrome tools.

02:38.250 --> 02:43.710
So this is an iPhone 6 7 and 8 and everything looks pretty good.

02:43.710 --> 02:46.750
Obviously iPhone X is going to look good.

02:46.980 --> 02:52.810
Even the iPhone 5 looks good OK.

02:53.620 --> 02:57.620
And if we take a look at let's do iPhone X and let's do.

02:58.780 --> 03:01.450
What does it landscape.

03:01.450 --> 03:04.330
So that's what it's going to look like on landscape.

03:04.330 --> 03:09.970
We're gonna be using VH units for the showcase so it should look good on all devices.

03:10.030 --> 03:10.360
All right.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.320
That's the goal here.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.090
So that's it.

03:13.090 --> 03:17.280
Hopefully guys enjoy this project and we're gonna jump in and get started.
