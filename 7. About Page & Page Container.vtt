WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:00.480
All right.

00:00.480 --> 00:06.150
So our home page is pretty much done aside from the responsive stuff that we're gonna do our media queries

00:06.150 --> 00:06.920
later on.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.100
So we're gonna start on the.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.140
About in the article Dot.

00:10.140 --> 00:15.170
Each team L page so let's open up about what each team L..

00:15.330 --> 00:23.340
And we're gonna be using you know the the nav bar the footer that stuff from the index page so I'm gonna

00:23.370 --> 00:29.850
copy the whole index page and paste that in about and then we're gonna go up to the top here.

00:29.850 --> 00:36.620
Let's change the title here to just about and let's remove the current.

00:36.630 --> 00:39.030
We have a class of current on the link here.

00:39.030 --> 00:43.700
We're gonna move that to the to the about page class current.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.620
We're not going to have a showcase.

00:46.620 --> 00:51.510
We can actually get rid of everything in between the nav bar and the footer.

00:51.510 --> 00:57.060
So we'll get rid of all that stuff and if I save and we go to about we just have the the header and

00:57.060 --> 01:02.460
the footer so this is basically your boilerplate for any other page you want to create on this Web site.

01:02.580 --> 01:08.600
A lot of page a lot of page a lot of times what I will do when I'm building something like this is I'll

01:08.600 --> 01:14.310
I'll take this and in name it like boilerplate on each team l That way if I need to create another page

01:14.310 --> 01:15.720
I have all this.

01:15.720 --> 01:15.960
All right.

01:15.960 --> 01:22.200
And when later on when you get into actual programming and whether it's P HP or no J.S. whatever it

01:22.200 --> 01:28.320
may be if you get into front and frameworks like react in view J.S. you're not going to have to copy

01:28.320 --> 01:29.250
everything like this.

01:29.250 --> 01:35.130
You can have what are called partials or if you're using a front end frame framework you can have components

01:35.160 --> 01:37.440
that you can simply include into your file.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.160
That way you don't have to do all this and for every single page.

01:41.160 --> 01:41.460
All right.

01:41.460 --> 01:45.840
Now we're gonna have a section here.

01:46.080 --> 01:54.150
So let's say section and we're gonna given an idea of a boat and then inside here we're gonna have a

01:54.150 --> 01:59.880
container case that's just going to align everything to the middle but then we're also going to have

01:59.910 --> 02:03.270
a page container which is gonna be our grid container.

02:03.270 --> 02:07.200
And this page container we're gonna use on any in our pages.

02:07.200 --> 02:13.410
So the about in the article dot each team Allen if you wanted to create more pages we could use this

02:13.410 --> 02:14.750
as well it's going to set it up.

02:14.760 --> 02:20.460
It's going to it's going to create a grid layout so that we have a main area and then anything else

02:20.460 --> 02:23.280
we add will just be sidebar widgets basically.

02:23.910 --> 02:32.340
So in this page container let's create our first grid item which is gonna be an article and we're gonna

02:32.340 --> 02:38.580
give this a class of card because we want to have that white background with the padding and then let's

02:38.580 --> 02:43.620
do an H1 and I'm gonna give us a class of L heading because I want this to be a larger heading than

02:43.700 --> 02:44.620
the normal.

02:44.730 --> 02:54.120
And let's just say about our organization and then we're gonna do let's do a paragraph this paragraph

02:54.150 --> 03:05.530
with Lorem 50 and then let's do another paragraph still within the article and we'll say Lorem 100 like

03:05.540 --> 03:09.360
that let's do Lorem 150

03:12.820 --> 03:21.190
so next thing is gonna be in a side so let's say a side and this is just gonna be that little join our

03:21.190 --> 03:22.230
club thing.

03:22.270 --> 03:27.730
So I'm going to give this a class of card but I also want it to be read I want or have the primary colors

03:27.750 --> 03:33.730
so I'm going to do BGP dash primary I should probably put class in here

03:36.390 --> 03:45.480
so class card and BJP primary and then let's do an H two and let's say join our club by the way I have

03:45.480 --> 03:46.950
no idea what the club is.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.630
It's just an example of of content widget.

03:50.910 --> 03:52.400
So let's put paragraph here.

03:52.410 --> 04:02.250
Let's do Lorem 10 and underneath that we'll just put an A tag with the class of B.T. n and let's do

04:03.060 --> 04:11.130
a dark button so we'll do B T and let's to be t n dash dark and then I also want this to go all the

04:11.130 --> 04:19.080
way across its container so let's add B T N block which I'm about 90 percent sure we we added in the

04:19.080 --> 04:21.030
C Ss already but I'm gonna have to check.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.580
So let's say Join Now.

04:23.580 --> 04:23.810
Yeah.

04:23.820 --> 04:28.960
If we look at style CSX I just want to make sure that I added this PETN.

04:28.970 --> 04:29.550
BLOCK Yeah.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.740
So it's going to go 100 percent across.

04:31.740 --> 04:36.350
Gonna be display block all right so I think that's it.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.830
Let's save this.

04:38.190 --> 04:41.430
And basically we just have we just have our content.

04:41.560 --> 04:47.580
You know all on one line here we want to set this to a grid and we want to have this be the main part.

04:47.580 --> 04:53.070
And then this be in the sidebar and then anything else we add I want to be in the sidebar as well.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.490
So let's let's go to our style sheet.

04:55.530 --> 05:01.220
And there's nothing really we have to add that specific to the about page just the page container.

05:01.380 --> 05:04.380
So we're gonna go down.

05:04.380 --> 05:07.990
Let's put this.

05:08.430 --> 05:16.350
I don't want to put it as a utility cloud or I guess I guess it kind of is a utility because we're gonna

05:16.370 --> 05:22.790
use it in multiple page multiple pages so yeah we'll put it right below here below the list.

05:22.790 --> 05:31.250
So let's say page dash container and just going to put a comment here and say that this is the inner

05:31.550 --> 05:37.490
page container or grid container.

05:37.490 --> 05:51.270
So let's display grid and then we're gonna do grid dash template dash columns and the split that I want

05:51.270 --> 05:56.380
to use is going to be five f FIA and too far OK.

05:56.430 --> 06:03.220
And you can experiment with how thin or or wide you want the sidebar to be but I'm going to use that.

06:03.230 --> 06:07.210
Now how this is now with this stretching all the way down.

06:07.290 --> 06:13.110
I mean it's gonna do this because it's just it's a five FIA to a fire and there are gonna be the same

06:13.110 --> 06:15.740
height you may want to do this.

06:15.750 --> 06:20.240
You may want to add another like piece of content in the same box.

06:20.250 --> 06:25.480
But what I want to do is have this be completely separate box from the next one.

06:25.500 --> 06:25.790
All right.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.530
So it's up to you how you want to lay it out.

06:27.540 --> 06:35.040
You might want to do something like this but let's let's go and say we want the page container and we

06:35.040 --> 06:37.020
want the first child.

06:37.050 --> 06:45.360
So basically the main article so I'm just going to say asterisk cone first child and I want to span

06:45.360 --> 06:55.920
this across rows so going to say grid dash row we want to start at 1 and then we want to span let's

06:55.920 --> 06:58.410
spend three and save.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.210
OK.

06:59.220 --> 07:06.210
So now it's just going to span down three and whatever we put next is going to go right here and then

07:06.210 --> 07:12.180
right here and if you want to have more than three then you could you can increase this span and just

07:12.180 --> 07:15.270
have it span as long as you want.

07:15.270 --> 07:15.590
All right.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.720
So let's.

07:16.800 --> 07:23.340
This is all very close together so we're going to add some margin on the main container for the top

07:23.340 --> 07:28.820
and bottom so we'll say to ram top and bottom zero left and right.

07:28.950 --> 07:30.780
And then let's also do a grid gap.

07:30.780 --> 07:34.560
So we have some space in between the actual grid items.

07:34.560 --> 07:40.110
So grid gap is going to be one point five and save and then we go.

07:40.170 --> 07:46.410
Now we have our margin top and bottom here we also have a grid gap and you'll see that when we create

07:46.410 --> 07:49.460
our article page we're gonna have two boxes on the side.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.610
So the next thing I add would be right here next one would be here.

07:53.820 --> 07:59.430
And then after that it would go down over here because remember we're only spanning three and you could

07:59.430 --> 08:00.750
put this to whatever you want.

08:00.780 --> 08:06.830
Like if I put it to six it'll allow us to have six on the side but I'm just going to use three for now.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.450
That's fine.

08:08.490 --> 08:08.840
OK.

08:08.850 --> 08:14.670
So we have our home page we have our about page in the next video we're gonna start to work on our article

08:14.670 --> 08:15.210
page.
