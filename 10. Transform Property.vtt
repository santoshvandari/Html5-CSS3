WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:06.300
All right guys so we're going to look at the transform property now and this is a page from the MDA

00:06.460 --> 00:12.540
and Web site the Mozilla docs and it gives you a pretty good example of some of the effects that you

00:12.540 --> 00:16.190
can do with the transform so for instance we can rotate.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.190
I'm going to click off it first.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.830
This is skew so you can kind of skew it.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.420
You can rotate.

00:22.530 --> 00:23.760
You can scale.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.240
So make it bigger you can translate which is basically move it around matrix.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.430
So we're going to look at some of these properties.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.970
And we're also going to kind of integrate it with transitions.

00:37.470 --> 00:47.580
So let's create a new file called 10 underscore transform dot HD email

00:51.700 --> 00:56.670
say transform and put in our style.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.530
And again I'm just going to have a glass of box.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.770
So we're just working with this box here.

01:01.780 --> 01:06.920
And I'm just going to copy from the transitions.

01:06.930 --> 01:10.920
I'm going to copy the whole body because I just want to a box in the middle.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.550
Actually I'll just grab both of these.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.650
Grab the hover as well and I'll just delete some stuff.

01:16.650 --> 01:24.030
So it's paste that in and I'm going to keep for the box the background the width and the height and

01:24.060 --> 01:26.360
I'll get rid of all the hover for now.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.850
And I'm actually going to set it to 300 pixels.

01:30.930 --> 01:31.230
All right.

01:31.260 --> 01:37.530
So let's save that and let's open this with live server we have a 300 pixel wide three a pixel height

01:37.620 --> 01:39.660
box in the middle of the screen.

01:39.870 --> 01:41.610
And let's apply a transform.

01:41.610 --> 01:53.790
So we'll go to the box here and let's say transform and then we're gonna have an effect let's use rotate.

01:53.790 --> 02:00.120
OK so we'll say rotate and that's going to take in whatever the amount you want to rotate let's say

02:00.130 --> 02:01.990
25 TEGA.

02:02.130 --> 02:05.130
So 25 degrees and we'll save.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.580
And that's going to rotate it.

02:06.630 --> 02:11.800
Now of course you could use rotate this rotate with animation with key frames transitions.

02:11.820 --> 02:17.140
But if you just wanted to have something tilted a little bit you could just use it directly like this.

02:17.160 --> 02:17.460
All right.

02:17.460 --> 02:21.470
So next we're going to look at let's let's comment this.

02:21.480 --> 02:29.190
So next we're going to look at SKU which we'll just kind of skew it diagonally Diak diagonally Is that

02:29.220 --> 02:30.530
a word diagonal.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.430
And let's try that.

02:32.440 --> 02:32.660
OK.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.500
So you can see what SKU does.

02:34.500 --> 02:42.870
And this is nice if you want to have diagonal lines like in your layout if you want to have maybe you

02:42.870 --> 02:47.970
know a little showcase area where you have something on this side something on this side and you want

02:47.970 --> 02:53.190
to diagonal line in the middle instead of just having it half and half like that.

02:53.190 --> 02:55.980
So that is SKU.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.310
Let's see its costs.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.030
Copy this down and common this.

02:59.050 --> 03:02.810
So and let's look at scale.

03:03.090 --> 03:09.940
So scale let's just put in two and that's just going to scale it up.

03:09.960 --> 03:15.930
So essentially we're doubling in size we could put three and we'll scale even more.

03:15.930 --> 03:16.260
All right.

03:16.290 --> 03:29.190
So it's comment that out now the next thing I want to show you is is how to use transform with transitions.

03:29.210 --> 03:39.550
So I'm going to add a transition for all elements that are animated bill and let's do one second is

03:39.560 --> 03:42.060
an out OK.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.710
And then let's just save that.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.130
That's going to go back down and in our hover.

03:47.430 --> 03:49.950
Let's let's do the rotate

03:52.490 --> 03:58.160
so to rotate instead of 25 though let's do 180.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.140
So now when I hover over it it rotates when I hover off it goes back.

04:04.220 --> 04:05.990
So pretty cool.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.220
We can also skew it.

04:08.670 --> 04:09.470
Let's grab that

04:13.690 --> 04:21.440
so now when I hover over it it skews and this this is going to basically you know overwrite the rotate

04:23.180 --> 04:25.340
and then we can also do scale

04:30.620 --> 04:32.630
so we save that and I hover over it.

04:32.650 --> 04:34.040
It'll scale up.

04:34.140 --> 04:40.500
Now we can also move this around the page without having to do like a position relative and then doing

04:40.500 --> 04:42.600
top bottom left right properties.

04:42.600 --> 04:48.270
And we can do that by using translate case we have translate we have translate X translate y so we can

04:48.270 --> 04:53.140
move it along the x axis in the y axis.

04:53.250 --> 05:06.870
So let's actually comment this stuff out and let's do a trance form and then we're gonna set it to translate

05:07.110 --> 05:14.290
let's to translate y and let's say one hundred pixels.

05:14.440 --> 05:14.720
All right.

05:14.750 --> 05:15.830
So let's save that.

05:15.840 --> 05:22.390
Now when I hover over this it's going to move it down a hundred pixels.

05:22.740 --> 05:30.000
So I didn't have to do like a position relative or a top top one whatever property.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.580
It just simply moves a hundred pixels.

05:33.280 --> 05:39.030
And now if I want to move it up on the y axis I can simply put a negative value so negative 100 is going

05:39.030 --> 05:40.090
to move it up.

05:40.650 --> 05:48.620
And if I want to do on the x axis I can do translate X to 100 pixels.

05:48.930 --> 05:54.570
And that's going to go over and if I want to go the other way I could of course do a negative value

05:54.570 --> 05:56.360
there.

05:56.370 --> 06:03.390
Now let's say I want to move it on the x and y axis I can just use translate.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.100
I can say transform

06:07.420 --> 06:08.660
translate.

06:09.060 --> 06:15.770
And this is gonna take in the x and the Y parameters so let's say one hundred pixels on the x axis one

06:15.760 --> 06:18.070
hundred pixels on the y axis.

06:18.130 --> 06:22.580
And now when I hover over it it will go one hundred over and one hundred down.

06:23.010 --> 06:26.420
And of course I could use negative values if I wanted to.

06:26.670 --> 06:34.080
Now for if you want to increase performance you can actually use translate 3D which I don't use all

06:34.080 --> 06:42.820
that much but we can do translate 3D and let's actually comment this stuff.

06:43.530 --> 06:49.800
So if we use translate 3D this actually has to have a z value as well.

06:49.950 --> 06:53.570
So hundred pixels and that's gonna do the same thing.

06:54.550 --> 06:55.790
OK.

06:55.890 --> 07:01.620
And I believe it increases performance if you use translate 3D and you can do some really cool things

07:01.620 --> 07:03.640
I mean I'm not that familiar with it.

07:03.690 --> 07:08.000
I usually use translate but it is available to us.

07:08.130 --> 07:08.370
All right.

07:08.370 --> 07:14.100
So that's the transform property we'll be using this later on in other projects but that's going to

07:14.100 --> 07:16.650
be it for this video guys and I'll see you in the next one.
