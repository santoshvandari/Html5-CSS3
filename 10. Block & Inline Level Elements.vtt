00:00.350 --> 00:05.330
All right guys in this video we're gonna look at inline level elements and block level elements.

00:05.340 --> 00:10.710
Now certain tags or H2 metal elements are blocked some are in line.

00:10.710 --> 00:14.990
Now this is a page from W3 schools which is a great reference site.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.050
And it shows us which elements are block and which are in line.

00:19.050 --> 00:26.430
So all of these tags right here are block level so we have power graph form all the H tags the heading

00:26.430 --> 00:29.100
tags these header section all this stuff.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.850
These are h HTML5 semantic tags nav Main.

00:32.930 --> 00:34.680
I'm going to talk about those in a little bit.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.380
Those are very important but for now let's check.

00:37.410 --> 00:44.430
Let's look at the ones that we know like paragraph ordered lists unordered list list item all of these

00:44.430 --> 00:53.550
are block level and then for inline we have a tags which are links we have C button we have span we

00:53.550 --> 01:00.930
didn't talk about spans yet select what else here have we looked at these these bold and italics we're

01:00.930 --> 01:05.940
not going to be using those anymore emphasised strong text area.

01:06.030 --> 01:06.990
These are inline.

01:06.990 --> 01:15.360
Now the difference here is that a block level element will span 100 percent width of the page.

01:15.390 --> 01:15.670
OK.

01:15.690 --> 01:20.610
So it basically goes across the whole page and then the next thing that you put on the page is going

01:20.610 --> 01:27.000
to be on the next line because it knocks it down to the next line in inline element does not span across

01:27.000 --> 01:29.520
the page it only takes up that space.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.150
Therefore the next thing you put is going to go to the right of it.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.030
It's just going to go right after it.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.020
So let me give you some examples.

01:37.030 --> 01:37.320
OK.

01:37.350 --> 01:45.280
So it's open let's create a file here I'll call it 0 8 underscore block underscore inline dot aged him

01:45.280 --> 01:48.480
out and we'll go ahead and put our structure in here.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.310
Let's say in line

01:53.420 --> 01:58.850
in line versus block and inside the body here.

01:58.890 --> 02:07.450
Let's go ahead and put a paragraph which is a block level element and I'll say Lorem let's do Lorem

02:07.500 --> 02:11.580
30 tab or enter and we'll save that.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.130
Let's go ahead and open this with live server.

02:14.630 --> 02:14.960
OK.

02:14.970 --> 02:16.990
So this is a block level element.

02:17.370 --> 02:26.130
If I put another paragraph underneath it all right let's say Lorem 20 tab.

02:26.130 --> 02:31.920
Notice how it gets pushed on to the next line paragraphs actually have styling by default see the space

02:31.920 --> 02:37.140
here they actually have default margin which I'm going to we'll talk about when we get to the CSX but

02:37.140 --> 02:43.510
since it's block level it goes across the whole page and pushes the next one onto the next line.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.300
Now a link in a tag is an inline element.

02:47.310 --> 02:53.360
So let's go ahead and let's put a link not within a paragraph but just a link itself.

02:53.360 --> 02:59.200
And if we put out no sign that just means it goes to the current page Iran it doesn't go anywhere and

02:59.200 --> 03:02.430
in here let's just say a link.

03:02.430 --> 03:10.620
And if I save it this is an inline element which means if we add another link copy this down and I save

03:11.120 --> 03:16.140
notice that it goes next to it it doesn't get pushed on to the next line because it doesn't it doesn't

03:16.140 --> 03:18.350
span all the way across.

03:18.350 --> 03:18.630
OK.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.420
So that's the difference here.

03:20.460 --> 03:27.360
Now I'm going to add a style attribute because I want to put a border around all of these just so you

03:27.360 --> 03:30.630
can see kind of the outline of them.

03:30.660 --> 03:36.080
And again I don't suggest using style tags you want to use CSX but we haven't gotten to that yet.

03:36.090 --> 03:41.910
I'm just showing you this for an example and you'll learn all about borders and stuff later on but I'm

03:41.910 --> 03:47.360
just going to say border Greens solid and we'll do the same with the next one.

03:47.670 --> 03:54.510
So just copy this and let's save that and you can see that it goes all the way across.

03:54.510 --> 03:57.290
Now let's at a red border to the link.

03:58.230 --> 04:00.480
So I'm just going to change this to red

04:04.860 --> 04:10.780
read and save and you can see that it doesn't go all the way across.

04:10.860 --> 04:16.170
Now you might be saying well these paragraphs are you know they're long they reach all the way across

04:16.170 --> 04:18.760
the page but this doesn't the end doesn't.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.270
If it were in line the next one would start right here.

04:22.290 --> 04:28.200
So even if I just had a one word paragraph and I save it goes all the way across.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.050
OK so that's the difference.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.310
And it's very important to understand that.

04:33.360 --> 04:39.370
So another block level element is an unordered list as well as list items.

04:39.390 --> 04:47.610
So when I put a s when I put a list item in here and another one it knocks it down to the next line

04:47.640 --> 04:56.010
because it's it's a block level element and you can change the you can change it from inline to block

04:56.040 --> 04:59.850
or vice versa using CSX and we're gonna get into that later.

04:59.940 --> 05:08.570
But I just want you to understand the difference between inline and block and then those not span.

05:08.580 --> 05:14.880
I want to do a strong the topography semantic tags like strong and

05:17.850 --> 05:19.170
strong and emphasis.

05:19.170 --> 05:25.920
Those are also obviously in line because you can see we can make this strong but it doesn't knock it

05:25.920 --> 05:27.270
down to the next line.

05:27.270 --> 05:35.610
So these these are inline and you also have something called inline block which I'll talk about when

05:35.610 --> 05:40.300
we get to CSX because it doesn't really pertain to to just each team out.

05:40.370 --> 05:40.610
OK.

05:40.620 --> 05:46.020
So hopefully that makes sense guys I just wanted to clear that up before we move on in the next video

05:46.020 --> 05:50.820
we're going to talk a little bit about divs with I.D. and classes.
