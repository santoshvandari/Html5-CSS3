All right so you've completed the modern age HD Clancy CSX from the beginning course.

00:04.980 --> 00:10.070
First off I just want to say congratulations this wasn't a short course and making it all the way through

00:10.070 --> 00:11.530
is a real accomplishment.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.050
So I really hope you enjoy that.

00:13.050 --> 00:17.940
I hope you learned a lot from it and I just want to thank you for taking it and taking any other courses

00:17.940 --> 00:19.980
or tutorials that you've watched of mine.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.120
So the question is what now.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.630
What do you do next.

00:24.630 --> 00:30.810
Now you have a decent understanding of each team LCROSS SAS along with some of the basic principles

00:30.810 --> 00:33.920
of how Web sites work deployment and so on.

00:33.930 --> 00:39.120
So my advice would be to build a few projects based on what you've learned to look at some examples

00:39.120 --> 00:45.600
of other Web sites or other Web site themes and try to rebuild them without looking at any of the source

00:45.600 --> 00:50.500
code you want to you know use stuff that you've learned in this course.

00:50.520 --> 00:56.790
Go go look at documentation look at other tutorials maybe some other courses if you want to do something

00:56.790 --> 01:02.130
completely custom and create a mock up in photoshop or some other program and then write out the each

01:02.130 --> 01:03.110
team on CSX.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.680
That's even better.

01:04.710 --> 01:09.530
I would also suggest learning javascript that's probably the most logical next step.

01:09.690 --> 01:14.220
You want to get some programming under your belt and Javascript is great because it's just everywhere

01:14.220 --> 01:15.520
it runs in the browser.

01:15.570 --> 01:16.770
It runs on the server.

01:16.770 --> 01:19.020
There's mobile apps built with JavaScript.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.870
It's just a great language to learn.

01:20.970 --> 01:26.340
And I think that every web developer needs to know at least the basics of Javascript.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.390
I do have a 21 hour course on udemy called Modern javascript from the beginning.

01:31.290 --> 01:37.440
Now you might want to learn something like bootstrap which is a CSX framework it makes creating Web

01:37.440 --> 01:43.000
sites and user interfaces much easier because it's predefined styles predefined classes.

01:43.230 --> 01:48.480
However you want to make sure you customize your your projects if you do use a framework.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.520
Because a lot of them can start to look the same.

01:51.540 --> 01:54.160
So just keep that in mind but you may find it useful.

01:54.210 --> 01:57.740
It can speed things up and it's great for prototyping.

01:57.750 --> 02:04.530
If you're going to learn you know web application development so other than that I would say you know

02:04.530 --> 02:05.680
code every day.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.210
Try to stay driven and passionate.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.520
Try new things.

02:09.540 --> 02:13.620
And if this is what you really want to do as long as you put your all into it you're going to get to

02:13.620 --> 02:15.170
where you want to be.

02:15.180 --> 02:15.960
So that's it.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.500
Again thank you for taking the course and hopefully I'll see you in the next one.
