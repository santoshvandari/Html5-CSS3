WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:05.490
All right guys so we're gonna jump in to CSX grid here and I've created a whole new folder called CSX

00:05.490 --> 00:07.080
grid sandbox.

00:07.080 --> 00:15.180
And when I create a new file called 0 1 underscore grid underscore columns dot h t AML and we're gonna

00:15.180 --> 00:18.000
go over just the basics of how the grid works.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.050
Also the grid template columns property.

00:21.210 --> 00:25.110
So I'm going to close the sidebar up and will generate our boilerplate here.

00:25.140 --> 00:34.410
Let's say grid columns and style and the fact that you know flex blocks if you've been following along

00:34.410 --> 00:40.110
with the course is going to benefit you because the grid works in a similar way where we take a parent

00:40.140 --> 00:44.490
element and we set display grid just like we would do display flex.

00:44.610 --> 00:49.900
And it makes all the child elements of that of that parent.

00:50.010 --> 00:57.470
It makes them grid items and then we can add specific properties on the parent to affect the grid items.

00:57.470 --> 01:00.510
So let's go ahead and create our mark up.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.480
I'm just gonna do a class of grid.

01:02.490 --> 01:04.440
This is gonna be the container.

01:04.530 --> 01:08.190
And it does it doesn't matter what you call the class obviously I just call that grid.

01:08.190 --> 01:11.820
And then let's do a few divs with the class of item.

01:11.940 --> 01:19.180
So we'll just for the content we'll say item and then incrementing number and we'll do times three guys

01:19.200 --> 01:23.760
we have three div elements inside of our container here.

01:24.180 --> 01:30.810
So let's let's style the items first of all just so we can kind of get a better visual picture of how

01:30.810 --> 01:31.400
this works.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.310
So I'm going to add let's say padding.

01:35.610 --> 01:48.760
We'll do three ram and let's do a border one pixels solid and a background of light grey.

01:49.360 --> 02:04.030
Let's do a font size of one point three ram we'll do font weight fold and let's do text align center.

02:04.030 --> 02:04.320
All right.

02:04.360 --> 02:10.090
So let's save this and we'll go ahead and open the sub with live server and we just have our three element

02:10.210 --> 02:11.260
three items here.

02:11.680 --> 02:18.810
So what we need to do now is add for this this parent right here this div we want to add display grid.

02:18.820 --> 02:25.630
So I'm going to say the class of grid we want to do display and then grid.

02:25.630 --> 02:26.110
OK.

02:26.110 --> 02:31.540
Now if I save that nothing happens it's not like flex where it automatically turns into a flex row.

02:31.660 --> 02:36.840
What we need to do is add a another property called GRID template columns.

02:36.970 --> 02:40.840
So let's say a grid dash template.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.070
Dash columns.

02:43.300 --> 02:51.190
And here's where we specify how many columns we want and also the width of those columns.

02:51.190 --> 02:57.580
OK so basically by columns I mean we'll have one column another column so basically going in a horizontal

02:57.580 --> 02:58.270
row.

02:58.390 --> 03:05.470
So let's say we want to do three columns that are 200 pixels wide so 200 pixels for the first second

03:06.040 --> 03:07.180
and third.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.210
And if I save that that's exactly what we get.

03:10.210 --> 03:13.390
OK so no floats or anything like that.

03:13.390 --> 03:17.440
We simply create the number of columns we want and the width.

03:17.440 --> 03:23.430
Now even if we have more than 3 3 great items here.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.000
That's absolutely fine it's just going to continue on to the next line.

03:27.040 --> 03:36.420
So if I were to copy this down and say 4 and save it's just going to go right into the next spot.

03:36.610 --> 03:36.850
OK.

03:36.880 --> 03:45.040
If we do two more and we say five six and save it's just going to it's just going to keep going in this

03:45.160 --> 03:47.230
in this sequence.

03:47.230 --> 03:47.500
All right.

03:47.530 --> 03:53.240
So this is great for like new sites which is what one of the projects that we're going to build.

03:53.260 --> 03:57.800
It's great for image galleries and it's just great for all just basic layout.

03:57.910 --> 04:03.110
It's just to if you want just a main area with a side bar you simply set two columns.

04:03.160 --> 04:03.490
All right.

04:03.490 --> 04:10.700
Now this obviously doesn't go all the way across its container which which is container is the viewport.

04:11.080 --> 04:16.750
But let's say we wanted the middle one to stretch so that this went all the way across.

04:16.750 --> 04:23.590
We could use auto so if I put an auto here and I save now it's going to give it the length that it needs

04:23.590 --> 04:28.480
to fill the container and if I stretch it out it's always going to fill its container.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.390
OK.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.900
And let's say I wanted them all to be the same but I wanted them to fill the container I could do this.

04:34.900 --> 04:42.640
I mean just copy this down car comment this so and instead of doing the two hundred pixels let's do

04:43.600 --> 04:52.450
auto let's do it three times OK so now we have three columns that are all the same size if we wanted

04:52.450 --> 04:56.050
for we could add in another one like that.

04:56.140 --> 05:02.020
Now there's a better way to do this if you're gonna be repeating the same width like this.

05:02.020 --> 05:08.260
You can simply use repeats and then this takes in two things it takes in the number of times you want

05:08.260 --> 05:11.100
to repeat which I'm going to say three and then the width.

05:11.110 --> 05:15.740
You want to repeat which I'll do auto and save and you see we get the same result.

05:15.760 --> 05:22.480
If I were to put let's say 200 pixels in here and save it's going to repeat 200 pixels three times.

05:22.510 --> 05:26.100
So this is a much nicer way to do it.

05:26.110 --> 05:32.530
Now we used pixels here you can also use other units you can use percentages but the most common unit

05:32.530 --> 05:36.460
you're going to see when using the grid is an F R unit which is a fraction.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.740
So it's basically a fraction of the page in it.

05:38.980 --> 05:47.140
It works similar to how the the the Flex property works and we say flex one flex to you know it's work

05:47.140 --> 05:48.160
similar to that.

05:48.190 --> 05:52.920
So I'm going to copy this down and comment that out.

05:52.930 --> 05:55.360
I just want you guys to have this as a reference.

05:55.360 --> 06:05.860
But we can do let's say one FIA for the first row too far for the second and one far for the third and

06:05.860 --> 06:06.870
we'll save.

06:06.880 --> 06:13.480
And you can see that it's split up into fractions and the second one is larger and if I wanted it even

06:13.480 --> 06:17.330
larger I could do three FDR and it will extend more.

06:17.430 --> 06:18.210
OK.

06:18.240 --> 06:23.590
So I wanted to do two and then maybe two on the end so we'll have one short and then two longer ones

06:23.590 --> 06:26.880
we could do that could do any combination we want.

06:27.010 --> 06:31.160
And of course we can do repeat with FIA as well.

06:31.870 --> 06:38.050
And that's usually what I would do is repeat 3 1 FIA if I wanted three columns that were all the same

06:38.050 --> 06:38.970
with.

06:39.070 --> 06:42.480
Now notice that these are all stuck together.

06:42.490 --> 06:42.880
Right.

06:42.880 --> 06:49.600
So instead of adding margin there's actually a specific property we can use called GRID gap.

06:49.860 --> 06:50.110
OK.

06:50.200 --> 06:55.990
So we're going to say grid gap and you can put any unit here pixels whatever I'm just gonna do one room

06:56.470 --> 06:59.760
and save and it's automatically going to add that gap.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.780
That's spacing in between.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.200
All right.

07:02.200 --> 07:08.200
And there's no dealing with you know calculating widths or anything like that it just it just simply

07:08.200 --> 07:16.750
works and it doesn't matter how how wider or narrow the browser is either.

07:16.750 --> 07:17.050
All right.

07:17.080 --> 07:23.950
So that's pretty much the basics of how to create a grid and create basically a horizontal row with

07:23.950 --> 07:25.320
columns.

07:25.420 --> 07:31.970
What I want to show you now is just how easy it is to do a simple layout like a main area and a sidebar

07:31.990 --> 07:38.080
if you remember back to when we did the floats where we had to carefully choose the percentages we had

07:38.080 --> 07:40.060
to clear them stuff like that.

07:40.060 --> 07:47.620
So just want to show you how simple it is if we had let's say Main and inside main we want our main

07:47.620 --> 07:58.300
area our content area to be a section and we'll just put an H three say Welcome to my sites and we'll

07:58.300 --> 08:04.960
do a paragraph and say Lorem 30 and let's say we want an aside.

08:04.970 --> 08:09.590
So this would be our sidebar we'll just say whatever Hello.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.260
And let's say Lorem 10.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.220
OK so we're gonna save this and we want this to be our sidebar.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.130
So we want this to be over here.

08:19.180 --> 08:26.920
So with the grid we could take this main because that's the parent of the section and the aside and

08:26.920 --> 08:38.710
we could simply say display grid and we'll define our grid template columns and we'll simply do too

08:38.770 --> 08:45.550
far for the main area or for the section and then one F5 for the aside for the sidebar and then let's

08:45.550 --> 08:51.940
give it a grid gap of let's say one point five RAM and save and that's it.

08:52.380 --> 08:52.700
OK.

08:52.720 --> 08:58.050
So three lines instead of having to flow and deal with percentages it's very very simple.

08:58.120 --> 09:05.950
If we wanted to have it split in the middle we could do one fire one fire like that OK if we wanted

09:05.950 --> 09:08.260
this to be a little bigger we could do three Fia.

09:08.290 --> 09:15.800
So it's very simple to manipulate how your content is displayed and how things are aligned.

09:15.820 --> 09:16.090
All right.

09:16.090 --> 09:20.860
So in the next video we're gonna start to look at grid rows because up to this point we've looked at

09:20.860 --> 09:24.240
grid template columns but there's also a grid template rows.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.840
So we're gonna get into next.
