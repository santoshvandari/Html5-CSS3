WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:00.720
All right.

00:00.720 --> 00:07.500
So we deployed our Web site to nullify and we have our form working but our domain looks like this.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.860
So obviously you're not going to want that for your Web site.

00:10.860 --> 00:14.100
Now there's plenty of domain registrars out there.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.600
I go with name cheap there.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.210
They're cheap obviously.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.770
Also they're very reliable they have great support.

00:20.790 --> 00:25.440
I've been using them for years it's a company that I personally recommend they're not paying me a dime

00:25.440 --> 00:25.800
for this.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.660
However I do have an affiliate link that I'm going to include if you guys can use that.

00:29.670 --> 00:33.190
If you do purchase a domain that would mean a lot to me.

00:33.210 --> 00:35.490
So what you would do is just search.

00:35.490 --> 00:37.530
So let's say we wanted like news.

00:37.680 --> 00:44.480
Obviously news grid is taken let's search for like news grid site and click the search.

00:44.910 --> 00:46.720
And as you can see it is available.

00:46.730 --> 00:50.250
The dot dot com is available and it's 888 per year.

00:50.250 --> 00:50.500
OK.

00:50.520 --> 00:57.690
So pretty cheap and then down here you can see some other options like the dot net dot A.I. which is

00:57.690 --> 00:59.120
much more expensive.

00:59.370 --> 01:01.320
Dot org dot.

01:01.430 --> 01:04.600
Oh and then there's a bunch of other ones down here.

01:04.740 --> 01:10.230
Usually I would suggest if it's if it's a real site like your company's site I would suggest registering

01:10.230 --> 01:17.040
the dot com the dot net the dot org all the big T all I would suggest taking because you want to be

01:17.040 --> 01:23.040
in control of that especially if your company you know gets big and stuff like that but I'm not going

01:23.040 --> 01:27.150
to actually register a domain because I already have some so I'm going to going to use one of my my

01:27.780 --> 01:28.980
current domains.

01:29.010 --> 01:34.320
So once you register and you go through the process if you go to your dashboard you're going to see

01:34.320 --> 01:36.270
all of your active domains.

01:36.270 --> 01:41.070
Now the one that I'm going to use for this project is this app demo 12 dot com.

01:41.450 --> 01:41.710
OK.

01:41.730 --> 01:47.490
So going to go to manage and this is going to bring you to basically the control panel for that particular

01:47.490 --> 01:48.720
domain.

01:48.720 --> 01:55.100
Now before I do anything here we're going to go back to notify and step two as you can see is setup

01:55.170 --> 01:59.100
a custom domain and you're going to put in the domain you want to use.

01:59.110 --> 02:13.650
I'm going to say w w w dot app demo 112 dot com and click verify already has an owner is it you.

02:13.710 --> 02:14.430
Yes.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.000
Domain

02:20.980 --> 02:21.290
All right.

02:21.320 --> 02:27.890
So now here says by default your site is always accessible subdomain.

02:27.890 --> 02:32.960
So it's still going to be accessible through the net lo fi subdomain which is that this crazy domain

02:32.960 --> 02:34.180
here.

02:34.220 --> 02:41.390
Now there's a few things we need to do to connect app demo 112 dot com two to our account because if

02:41.390 --> 02:46.370
it just let us do it anyone could take any domain and connect it to that to that Web site.

02:46.850 --> 02:50.790
So I'm going to go to this.

02:50.930 --> 02:57.130
This documentation page here this custom domains documentation and scroll down.

02:57.470 --> 03:04.830
And this basically tells us what to do but it's kind of long winded so I'm going to go to see where

03:04.840 --> 03:15.400
is it's right here so we can use we can use nullifies built in DNS but I'm not going to do that I'm

03:15.400 --> 03:16.940
going to use this method here.

03:17.110 --> 03:22.780
It says create in a record pointing your route domain to our load balancers IP address which is this

03:22.780 --> 03:27.180
number here 1 0 4 1 9 8 1 4 5 2.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.840
So it's this is an IP address.

03:29.060 --> 03:29.300
OK.

03:29.350 --> 03:32.430
Remember we talked about this a long time ago.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.260
So we're going to copy this.

03:34.510 --> 03:40.810
This load balancer IP and we're gonna go to our domain panel and go to advanced DNS.

03:40.860 --> 03:41.290
OK.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.780
And remember it said create in a record.

03:43.780 --> 03:48.170
So down here you can see it says add new record.

03:48.230 --> 03:49.030
I'm going to click that.

03:49.030 --> 03:51.550
I'm going to choose a record for the hosts.

03:51.550 --> 03:58.510
We're gonna put the at symbol meaning just the root the root of the domain.

03:58.660 --> 04:03.550
And we're going to paste in that IP address and then click the checkmark.

04:03.550 --> 04:03.820
All right.

04:03.820 --> 04:08.520
And then the next thing we need to do is add a new record of a C name.

04:08.530 --> 04:16.030
OK so we're going to say C name and we're going to point W WW to whatever your nullified domain is which

04:16.030 --> 04:17.200
mine is this right here.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.480
So years will obviously be different.

04:19.480 --> 04:25.240
So I'm going to grab that and I'm going to put that in here inside the C name and we're gonna click

04:25.240 --> 04:26.410
the check.

04:26.500 --> 04:26.890
All right.

04:26.890 --> 04:34.670
Now this stuff up here I'm actually going to delete stuff those already here OK so we should we just

04:34.670 --> 04:37.220
have our a record and see Name Record.

04:37.220 --> 04:44.390
Now if you needed to have an e-mail addresses with this domain you would find a separate e-mail service

04:44.420 --> 04:47.540
and you would have to use what's called an M X record.

04:47.750 --> 04:53.920
But I'm not going to get into this in this video in this course we just want to deploy this Web site.

04:54.080 --> 05:03.350
So we have this stuff done so let's go back to our domain management page and let's reload and you can

05:03.350 --> 05:07.460
see now that check check status thing is gone and these are now green.

05:07.460 --> 05:12.320
So I don't know if it's going to work yet sometimes it takes a little while to propagate but let's try

05:12.320 --> 05:12.560
it out.

05:12.560 --> 05:20.010
We'll go to w w dot app demo 1 12:00 dot com.

05:20.010 --> 05:21.090
There it is.

05:21.090 --> 05:25.550
So it's as easy as that to create our domain.

05:25.560 --> 05:25.860
All right.

05:25.860 --> 05:29.780
And as you can see it's HDTV s and this is all free.

05:29.790 --> 05:33.690
Didn't pay a dime didn't put any credit card information in nothing.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.020
So it's it's a fantastic service really.

05:37.050 --> 05:40.560
So if we go back to overview everything is done.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.540
Everything is deployed we have our form just to test that out one more time we'll go down here.

05:45.540 --> 05:50.870
I'll just say Brad at g mail and subscribe back to site.

05:50.880 --> 05:56.520
We'll go back to our panel here and reload and if we look at the form submissions you can see Brad at

05:56.520 --> 05:57.230
g mail.

05:57.270 --> 05:57.890
So that's it.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.530
Our Web site is deployed and that's that.

06:00.690 --> 06:00.960
All right.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.520
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
