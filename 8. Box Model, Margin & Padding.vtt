WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:04.440
All right so in this video we're going to talk about the box model and we're gonna talk about margin

00:04.440 --> 00:08.130
and padding as well as what a C reset is.

00:08.130 --> 00:08.440
OK.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.190
We're also going to look at some of the default styling of the browser.

00:11.190 --> 00:19.560
So let's create a new file here called 0 6 underscore box underscore model dot h t email and to put

00:19.560 --> 00:32.370
in our head body tags and for the title we'll say box model margin and padding and put in our style

00:33.570 --> 00:38.350
and then for the each team l I'm going to put in a cloud a div with the class of box which is just going

00:38.350 --> 00:45.230
to have an h three we'll say box one and then a paragraph with 20 words or alarm 20.

00:45.240 --> 00:45.570
All right.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.570
And then I'm just going to copy this down.

00:47.580 --> 00:54.750
So shift option or shift Ault and then down or copy it and let's just we'll just change this to Box

00:54.750 --> 00:57.040
2 and they both have the same class.

00:57.110 --> 00:57.350
OK.

00:57.360 --> 01:01.110
Which is which is absolutely fine we're just going to style in the same way.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.230
So let's save this and open it with live server.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.590
Open it and chrome and I want to open up our dev tools.

01:07.590 --> 01:14.130
So on Mac it's command option I on Windows it's F 12 or you can use your here menu.

01:14.190 --> 01:16.920
So remember this is the H team all over here.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.500
This is a CSX.

01:18.570 --> 01:24.060
So I'm actually going to just click on the div right here the first div which will give us the CSX which

01:24.060 --> 01:30.210
by default just has a display block because remember divs by default are displayed as a block.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.090
Meaning they go all the way across.

01:32.190 --> 01:37.960
And right here you're going to see a diagram of the box model which makes it a lot easier to explain.

01:37.980 --> 01:43.500
So there's basically four layers there's that element itself which we can put a Hytner with property

01:43.500 --> 01:43.830
on.

01:43.830 --> 01:49.320
By default the width is all is all the way across and the height is going to be however much content

01:49.320 --> 01:50.070
is in it.

01:50.100 --> 01:56.580
If I had a bunch more paragraphs it's going to extend more or I can just set a height and CSX then we

01:56.580 --> 01:57.470
have padding.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.070
So we have spacing we can put here then we have the border.

02:01.170 --> 02:05.830
We looked at the border properties in the last video and then we have the margin.

02:05.940 --> 02:12.350
Now the margin in padding the spacing is some people get this confused when they first start.

02:12.540 --> 02:17.250
But all you really have to remember is the margin is the outside of the element or the outside of the

02:17.250 --> 02:19.230
board or the padding is the inside.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.240
OK.

02:20.250 --> 02:28.260
So to give you an example let me just add some styling for the box.

02:28.410 --> 02:32.010
So we're gonna see box we're going to say background.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.820
We're going to give it a color of light gray and then we'll give it a border.

02:38.820 --> 02:46.260
Let's say two pixels Gray solid and we went over the stuff in the last video.

02:46.260 --> 02:53.010
So now you can get a better picture of of the box model so we have the content then we have the padding

02:53.520 --> 02:57.670
and then we have the border and then outside of the borders the margin.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.200
Now notice that there's some spacing here.

03:01.230 --> 03:06.600
There's spacing here there's spacing here and there's even spacing around the sides that's because the

03:06.600 --> 03:11.190
browser has default margin impacting on certain elements.

03:11.220 --> 03:17.400
So if we grab the selector tool here and I hover over the h three you'll see that there's some orange

03:17.520 --> 03:19.590
areas here where the spaces.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.000
That's the margin.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.380
And if I go over the the paragraph we have some margin and even the body if I go right.

03:28.590 --> 03:30.060
Actually it's not going to let me show it.

03:30.930 --> 03:35.400
But anyways the body has some some margin as well.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.360
So let's click on this.

03:37.440 --> 03:43.440
The H3 and then over here you'll see the styling so this margin blocks start margin block and is basically

03:43.440 --> 03:45.300
margin top and bottom.

03:45.300 --> 03:52.710
And it has a value of 1 M and M is a relative unit it's relative to the number of pixels of the font

03:52.710 --> 03:56.230
size of its element of its parent container.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.850
And if you don't understand what that means don't worry about it.

03:58.860 --> 04:04.500
If you want to see the computed pixels you can actually click on computed and it will show you that

04:04.500 --> 04:12.060
the font size and the margin on the top and bottom for the H 3 is going to be it's 18 7 2 pixels by

04:12.060 --> 04:12.900
default.

04:13.140 --> 04:19.260
If we click on the paragraph you'll see that it has a margin on the top and bottom of 16 pixels.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.990
If I click on the body you can see it has a margin on all sides of eight pixels.

04:24.990 --> 04:28.140
And there you can see the orange around the whole body.

04:28.170 --> 04:28.460
OK.

04:28.470 --> 04:34.710
So these are all default browser styles and there's other elements as well like a well and unordered

04:34.710 --> 04:36.960
list and an ordered list.

04:36.960 --> 04:44.700
They both have margin on the top and bottom and they have a padding on the left of I believe 40 pixels.

04:44.730 --> 04:51.330
So this is just stuff that you that you're going to run into and you can overwrite those values obviously

04:51.330 --> 04:59.340
like I could set for paragraph I could set margin to to zero and get rid of that and I can actually

04:59.340 --> 05:00.330
show you that real quick.

05:00.360 --> 05:13.980
So if I say box paragraph and set margin to zero and save that we go back.

05:13.980 --> 05:19.740
Now if I you'll see that there's no orange when I hover over the paragraph and if we look at the styles

05:20.160 --> 05:23.040
you can still see the default but this overwrite it.

05:23.070 --> 05:23.990
What I just did.

05:24.660 --> 05:25.080
OK.

05:25.080 --> 05:31.470
Now if you want to take away all the default styling you can do that with what's called a reset.

05:31.470 --> 05:32.990
So I'm going to get rid of that.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.640
What I just did and I'm going to create C assess reset.

05:39.150 --> 05:39.510
OK.

05:39.510 --> 05:41.120
And there's different ways to reset.

05:41.130 --> 05:45.780
You can reset margin and padding font size borders.

05:45.870 --> 05:52.710
There is actually like a popular reset files that you can use like Eric Myers has a reset file that's

05:52.710 --> 05:53.540
pretty popular.

05:53.550 --> 06:00.300
But the easiest way to do it is just to use an asterisk which selects everything and then just say you

06:00.300 --> 06:04.980
want margin to be zero and padding to be zero.

06:05.150 --> 06:05.480
OK.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.210
So we're just setting the margin and padding to zero for everything.

06:09.210 --> 06:10.210
So let's save that.

06:10.230 --> 06:12.110
And this is on all sides.

06:12.350 --> 06:12.630
OK.

06:12.630 --> 06:14.700
Top Top Bottom Left and Right.

06:14.730 --> 06:20.430
So if we go back now notice there's no spacing anywhere not even on the body not even on the side here.

06:20.510 --> 06:26.640
And if I grab the selector tool there's no orange there's no green which is padding there's just no

06:26.640 --> 06:28.000
spacing at all.

06:28.020 --> 06:31.740
Now it's up to you on if you want to use a reset or not.

06:31.770 --> 06:39.330
I do sometimes it really depends on the layout but if you do use it you have to remember to add all

06:39.330 --> 06:46.230
of your your your own map margin and padding because now if I add another paragraph under this one it's

06:46.230 --> 06:50.790
going to be right next to it it's not going to have that that default spacing that the browser gives

06:50.790 --> 06:56.070
it same with the heading usually you'll want some space here it's not there anymore we will have to

06:56.070 --> 06:58.860
create it if we're going to keep the reset.

06:58.890 --> 06:59.210
All right.

06:59.220 --> 07:03.780
So I just wanted to kind of explain how the the default margin and padding works.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.780
Also the structure of the box model.

07:06.780 --> 07:11.160
So now let's look at some properties that have to do with margin in padding.

07:11.160 --> 07:22.590
So I'm going to add a width to the box as well it's do with 500 pixels and let's say want padding on

07:22.590 --> 07:24.240
all sides.

07:24.240 --> 07:30.030
So I'm going to put a comment right here and going to see padding on all sides.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.210
So we would just use padding and then we could do let's say 20 pixels.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.380
So this will put 20 pixels on all sides.

07:40.380 --> 07:46.050
You can see top and and notice the green when if I use the elements selector and we hover over it we

07:46.050 --> 07:48.910
see the green that's actually the padding OK.

07:49.020 --> 07:53.940
And you can see that it's 20 pixels on all sides for both obviously because they're both they both have

07:53.940 --> 07:57.510
the class of box which is what we styled.

07:57.720 --> 08:06.750
Now when we add padding if we if we keep the box sizing the way it is now the box sizing property it

08:06.750 --> 08:09.490
adds to the width of the entire thing.

08:09.510 --> 08:09.950
All right.

08:09.960 --> 08:19.440
And to just give you an example if I say padding 120 and we take a look at the width of this is no it's

08:19.440 --> 08:26.370
not 500 pixels it added to that it's 500 pixels plus the padding and that's not usually how you want

08:26.370 --> 08:31.670
to do it usually you want to keep the with at the right width and then just add the padding so to do

08:31.670 --> 08:35.360
that you want to add to the Astros right here.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.910
A box sizing property.

08:39.290 --> 08:41.900
And you want to set that to border box.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.390
So now if I save that we go back.

08:44.390 --> 08:49.790
We still have 120 pixels padding but the box is still 500 pixels.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.680
It just pushes it inside.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.000
OK.

08:52.070 --> 08:53.940
As opposed to adding it.

08:54.020 --> 09:01.220
So let's put that back to 20 I just made it that big just so just so you could tell that the width was

09:01.220 --> 09:08.110
larger so we'll put that back and the next thing I want to do is show you margin because right now there's

09:08.120 --> 09:11.030
no margin and these are kind of stuck together.

09:11.060 --> 09:15.590
So margin is gonna be spacing around the border on the outside of the border.

09:15.590 --> 09:26.440
So let's add a margin on all sides and we'll say margin 20 pixels.

09:26.660 --> 09:32.550
And if we take a look and we use our element selector see the orange that's the the margin.

09:32.690 --> 09:33.980
The green is the padding.

09:33.980 --> 09:38.720
Orange is the margin in fact if I click on one of the divs and we look at the box model it'll show us

09:38.720 --> 09:40.420
all the values 20.

09:40.430 --> 09:44.900
The border is two pixels the padding is 20 and then the width here.

09:45.510 --> 09:45.880
OK.

09:45.890 --> 09:51.620
So just remember that margin outside padding inside and it doesn't matter if you have a border property

09:51.620 --> 09:52.440
set or not.

09:52.460 --> 09:57.720
It's still it's still going to be relative to the box model.

09:57.860 --> 09:58.280
All right.

09:58.280 --> 10:05.090
Now these properties that we've used Matt Pat padding and margin with just one value it's putting the

10:05.090 --> 10:10.580
same on all sides but there may be cases where you want different values on different sides.

10:10.670 --> 10:18.620
So I'm going to go down here and let's say padding per side.

10:19.280 --> 10:19.860
OK.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.180
So we can use padding top.

10:23.810 --> 10:31.900
So let's say on the top we want 10 pixels and let's do padding bottom.

10:31.910 --> 10:34.310
Actually I want to do top stoop right.

10:34.370 --> 10:38.240
And I'm doing this in a certain order for a reason and I'll show you that in a minute.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.290
So padding right.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.300
Let's say we want 20 pixels

10:45.640 --> 10:47.610
let's do padding bottom.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.460
We'll do 10.

10:48.460 --> 10:51.910
Just like the top and then left.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.540
We'll do 20.

10:53.740 --> 10:54.720
Just like the right.

10:55.240 --> 10:55.600
OK.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.270
Now this is going to overwrite this and that's something that I really haven't talked about yet.

11:00.280 --> 11:07.060
When you have the same properties that are the ones that are further down are going to overwrite the

11:07.060 --> 11:08.360
ones that are further off.

11:08.410 --> 11:12.010
OK so all this padding here is going to overwrite this one.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.700
So even if I leave them without commenting.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.920
So this is going to take effect.

11:17.050 --> 11:20.170
So let's take a look and you can see now there's less padding.

11:20.170 --> 11:27.040
If you look at the green there's 10 pixels on the top and bottom there's 20 on the left and right.

11:27.100 --> 11:33.490
So if you want to do this but you don't want to have four different properties you can you can shorten

11:33.490 --> 11:38.280
this just like with with most cases like you saw with the with the border in the background there's

11:38.300 --> 11:39.680
there's short hands.

11:39.820 --> 11:45.940
So let's say padding shorthand.

11:45.940 --> 11:49.600
Now when we do this there's a certain order to the values.

11:49.600 --> 11:56.610
So it's gonna be this just like I did right above Top Right Bottom Left.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.480
That's why I did it in this order.

11:58.480 --> 12:04.660
So if we say padding it's gonna be in that order so let's do top 10 pixels.

12:04.780 --> 12:05.450
Right.

12:05.470 --> 12:12.490
Twenty pixels bottom 10 pixels left 20 pixels.

12:12.490 --> 12:16.590
So if I save that and we take a look it's gonna be the same thing.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.720
So this is just a shorthand for this.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.100
Does the exact same thing.

12:21.100 --> 12:27.310
Now we can make this even shorter because the top and bottom in the left and right are the same top

12:27.310 --> 12:29.640
and bottom 10 left and right or 20.

12:29.650 --> 12:37.530
So let's say padding shorthand so we can actually just have two values.

12:37.540 --> 12:42.670
One will be top bottom one will be left right.

12:43.660 --> 12:49.030
So we'll say padding top and bottom we want 10 left and right we want 20.

12:49.630 --> 12:49.870
OK.

12:49.980 --> 12:54.640
So this is the same exact thing is this which is the same exact thing is this.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.930
So we're just shortening it up.

12:56.240 --> 12:56.990
OK.

12:57.070 --> 13:02.620
So if we look at it we get the same exact thing we have the 10 on the top and bottom 20 on the left

13:02.620 --> 13:03.040
and right.

13:03.430 --> 13:04.890
So hopefully that makes sense.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.950
You can add padding all these different ways now with margin.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.600
It's the same exact thing.

13:10.660 --> 13:10.990
OK.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.940
Same exact thing I'm actually going to just copy all this and change it to margin.

13:14.950 --> 13:18.500
So margin top right left bottom this same thing.

13:18.520 --> 13:27.370
Same order so let's grab this and let's put this down here and just change this to margin

13:30.010 --> 13:31.570
change these to margin

13:36.250 --> 13:36.970
margin

13:46.310 --> 13:49.110
OK so that's gonna do same exact thing.

13:49.110 --> 13:51.210
Save that for Take a look.

13:51.210 --> 13:56.160
Now we have ten pixels top and bottom margin 20 left and right margin.

13:57.490 --> 13:57.820
OK.

13:57.880 --> 14:02.300
So yeah I think that that's all I want to do here.

14:02.310 --> 14:03.590
Oh one other thing.

14:03.690 --> 14:08.910
Usually since we did a reset we'd probably want to separate the h three in the paragraph a little bit.

14:08.940 --> 14:20.820
So what I would do is just add Box H three and I'd probably add like padding bottom 10 pixels five pixels

14:20.820 --> 14:22.660
whatever it may be.

14:22.670 --> 14:24.190
So happened here.

14:24.180 --> 14:28.620
Inside I'm inside this style.

14:28.620 --> 14:28.890
OK.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.090
So let's check that out.

14:30.090 --> 14:33.300
And now we have spacing under the heading.

14:33.300 --> 14:33.630
All right.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.400
So that's it guys in the next video we're going to start to talk about floats.

14:37.400 --> 14:37.720
OK.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.520
So we can align things now.

14:39.600 --> 14:45.750
Ultimately when you when you align stuff you're usually going to want to use flex box or the CSX grid.

14:45.840 --> 14:51.900
But we're not going to talk about that stuff just yet because that that stuff is a little more complicated

14:51.930 --> 14:53.360
and it's much newer.

14:53.370 --> 15:00.330
I want you to get a handle on just old fashioned floating before you start to deal with flex in grid

15:00.360 --> 15:01.590
and stuff like that.

15:01.590 --> 15:01.850
All right.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.380
So I'll see you in the next video.
