WEBVTT

00:00.580 --> 00:05.520
All right guys so now we're gonna jump into flex blocks and if you don't understand everything in this

00:05.520 --> 00:07.570
first video here don't worry about it.

00:07.650 --> 00:12.100
We're gonna be building an entire project an entire Web site using FLAC.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.730
So things are gonna come to you as we go.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.990
But I'm just going to use the CSF sandbox that we've been using.

00:17.990 --> 00:28.650
I'm going to create a file called 16 underscore flex underscore basics dot h t AML okay and we'll put

00:28.650 --> 00:39.210
in our boiler plate for our title we'll save flex basics and let's put in our style tags now for the

00:39.210 --> 00:39.830
body.

00:39.840 --> 00:47.490
I'm going to have a div I'm just gonna give it an idea of container and then let's do a div with the

00:47.490 --> 00:49.890
class of item we're going to have a couple of these.

00:49.890 --> 00:55.720
So for the content inside the item I want to have an h three K we're just using Emmet here.

00:55.750 --> 01:03.510
I'm gonna say item money sign which will be an incremented number and then I think that's it.

01:03.540 --> 01:11.880
So let's go ahead and hit I actually wanted two times three and then tab or enter and it will give us

01:11.880 --> 01:15.300
three divs class item and then h 3s.

01:15.330 --> 01:22.760
So if I save this and we take a look it's open with live server you'll see we just have our our divs

01:22.760 --> 01:33.890
here and I just want to style the items so for a class item let's just say background light grey we'll

01:33.890 --> 01:49.820
do a border of light grey and padding we'll say one room let's text aligned to the center and that should

01:49.820 --> 01:51.290
be good.

01:51.290 --> 01:55.230
And now we have some styling for each one here.

01:55.250 --> 02:01.970
Now remember what I said when we if we say display flex for this item here and for this element it becomes

02:01.970 --> 02:08.000
a flex container and then everything all the direct children which are these divs are going to become

02:08.000 --> 02:13.900
flex items which we can lay out horizontally or vertically in a column.

02:13.910 --> 02:22.130
So let's take that container and let's add a display property with a value of flex and as soon as I

02:22.130 --> 02:22.610
save.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.990
Notice what happens.

02:23.990 --> 02:26.530
They get aligned horizontally.

02:26.530 --> 02:32.930
K. so basically doing what like a float does with just this one line and it doesn't matter if these

02:32.930 --> 02:39.140
don't have classes it doesn't matter if these are divs or list elements or I'm sorry list items it doesn't

02:39.140 --> 02:46.610
matter anything that's a direct child of this flex item or this flex container I should say is a flex

02:46.610 --> 02:50.310
item and we'll automatically get put into a row.

02:50.420 --> 03:01.220
Now we can have flex items go this way in a column by setting flex direction to column.

03:01.340 --> 03:07.100
And if I save that now it goes back to a column and it's still a flex box we can still use the alignment

03:07.100 --> 03:12.350
classes and stuff that I'm going to show you in the next video but I want to keep this arrow so I'm

03:12.350 --> 03:17.090
just going to comment that out and I'm going to put this to Roe which is basically the same thing is

03:17.090 --> 03:19.880
not putting it at all because Roe is default.

03:19.910 --> 03:26.420
Oh actually I want to show you we can also do row reverse and if I save that notice that now three is

03:26.420 --> 03:34.220
the first one and they also get aligned over here and then yes you can do row reverse as well but we're

03:34.220 --> 03:36.970
going to stick to Roe.

03:37.070 --> 03:43.250
Now we can set specific widths to these if we want using flex basis in fact we're going to do that in

03:43.250 --> 03:44.360
the next video.

03:44.630 --> 03:51.710
But for the most part you're going to want your your horizontal items to go all the way across.

03:51.770 --> 03:52.040
OK.

03:52.040 --> 03:57.860
Regardless of which one takes up you know whatever amount of space you want them to go all the way across

03:57.860 --> 04:01.840
the container which in our case is the whole browser window.

04:01.850 --> 04:10.760
So what I'm going to do is set on on the item here I'm going to set flex 1 and save OK.

04:10.780 --> 04:15.020
And what that's going to do is it's going to make them all equal and it doesn't matter how I size the

04:15.020 --> 04:18.210
browser they're always going to be equal.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.530
So you can see how easy this is.

04:22.280 --> 04:28.070
After doing the floats remember we did the flow we did the with whatever I think we did like thirty

04:28.100 --> 04:34.520
thirty two point three percent and then we had to set the box sizing so that the with the padding didn't

04:34.520 --> 04:40.130
add to the width we had to clear them and it's just it's just a pain the height you have to add a height

04:40.160 --> 04:41.440
when you do the floats.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.210
This makes things so so much easier.

04:44.330 --> 04:50.660
And I know that it's another thing to learn but once you start using flex in the grid you you don't

04:50.660 --> 04:51.650
use float.

04:51.980 --> 04:56.670
Now aside from this course just to teach you guys I haven't used float in years.

04:57.170 --> 05:04.550
So let's say we wanted to do like a main area in a sidebar we didn't want them to be all equal so let's

05:04.550 --> 05:06.620
actually just take two of them.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.660
And even if we have to if they're set to flex one they're going to be equal.

05:11.090 --> 05:16.940
But what I'll do is I'll take the first one which I could give a custom class if I wanted to but what

05:16.940 --> 05:20.080
I'm going to do is use this pseudo selector first child.

05:20.090 --> 05:28.460
So going to say item colon first first child and that's going to select the first item and I'm going

05:28.460 --> 05:31.180
to set that flex property to two.

05:31.470 --> 05:38.000
OK so this first one has a flex of two and then the second one has flex of one.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.260
So let's save that.

05:39.410 --> 05:42.320
And now you'll see that this has more space.

05:42.320 --> 05:48.890
OK so easy way to set up a main area in a sidebar and it's going to stay like that no matter what.

05:49.610 --> 05:49.960
OK.

05:49.970 --> 05:55.470
If we wanted it to be even bigger we could say Flex Three and save and it gets even bigger.

05:56.430 --> 06:02.590
OK but I'm going to put this let's just put this back to one.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.120
Yeah we'll just do that.

06:06.620 --> 06:11.190
So let's see what else we want to show you guys in this video.

06:12.920 --> 06:18.310
If we wanted some margin because right now you can see there they're basically stuck to each other.

06:18.530 --> 06:22.050
So we could add margin to the item as well.

06:22.130 --> 06:32.420
So if I say margin let's do zero point seven five RAM and save and we get our margin let's put the third

06:32.420 --> 06:33.140
one back.

06:34.520 --> 06:34.930
OK.

06:34.930 --> 06:35.760
So no matter what.

06:35.780 --> 06:38.360
And now I can keep bringing I can keep bringing in more.

06:38.480 --> 06:43.430
Let's put that in it's just everything just works.

06:43.430 --> 06:45.660
It just aligns how it should.

06:46.010 --> 06:53.900
Now we do have a property called flex wrap because once you hit twelve it's gonna do one of two things

06:53.900 --> 06:58.490
it's going to keep it's going to go off the screen and you'll have a scroll bar or it'll wrap onto the

06:58.490 --> 06:59.180
next line.

06:59.180 --> 07:03.260
So what we have here one two three four five six seven eight.

07:03.320 --> 07:09.410
So let's do nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 and let's save.

07:09.470 --> 07:16.040
So notice now we have a scroll bar because it's not going to put more than 12 on the screen but if we

07:16.040 --> 07:24.290
wanted to wrap onto the next line we could go to our container and we could add a property of flax wrap

07:24.710 --> 07:26.740
and we could set that to wrap.

07:26.910 --> 07:28.940
OK so we have we have no wrap.

07:28.970 --> 07:29.600
We have wrap.

07:29.600 --> 07:35.640
We have wrapper verse which we just reverse some and save and I can see they go on to the next slide.

07:36.440 --> 07:36.770
All right.

07:36.770 --> 07:37.960
So and you can see.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.650
So it's pretty cool and think of it.

07:41.660 --> 07:46.760
Think of if we did like an image gallery or something you know it makes things much easier than having

07:46.760 --> 07:53.480
to float these clear them deal with the heights deal with you know all the crap that goes into floating

07:53.480 --> 07:54.780
the widths.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.770
So yeah it makes things much easier.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.440
So another thing that we can do.

08:00.710 --> 08:06.380
I'm trying to think of all the properties I want to display here we have flex flow which is basically

08:06.380 --> 08:10.880
a shortcut for the direction and the wrap.

08:11.350 --> 08:11.710
OK.

08:11.720 --> 08:19.620
So instead of putting both of these we could do flex flow and we could say we want a row and we want

08:19.620 --> 08:21.490
it to wrap.

08:21.530 --> 08:27.470
So that's the same as these two so if I comment these two out and save we get the same thing.

08:27.530 --> 08:33.470
If I wanted to change this to let's say no wrap and save now I can see there's no wrap.

08:33.470 --> 08:37.100
All right but I don't I personally don't usually use flex flow.

08:37.100 --> 08:45.260
I don't usually use wrap because I don't have in most cases I won't have more than twelve flex items.

08:45.260 --> 08:45.590
All right.

08:45.590 --> 08:49.300
So let's see I think that's it.

08:50.060 --> 08:50.380
Yeah.

08:50.390 --> 08:57.050
So in the next video I'm going to show you how we can work with the alignment properties like justify

08:57.080 --> 09:04.190
content a line items and stuff like that which are very useful if you know you don't have them spanning

09:04.190 --> 09:07.880
across the whole the whole parent container.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.890
All right so we'll get into alignment next.
