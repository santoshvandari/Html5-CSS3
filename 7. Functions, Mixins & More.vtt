WEBVTT

00:00.440 --> 00:00.950
All right guys.

00:00.970 --> 00:03.900
Now we're going to get into functions and mix ins.

00:03.930 --> 00:09.810
Now if you've ever worked with a programming language whether it's javascript HP any language at all

00:10.080 --> 00:12.370
you've probably worked with functions.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.870
It's basically just a block of code that you can keep calling so you don't have to keep repeating yourself.

00:17.880 --> 00:24.150
So what I want to do is create a new SAS file a partial so to say new file underscore we'll call this

00:24.210 --> 00:27.430
underscore functions dot SPSS.

00:27.430 --> 00:27.860
OK.

00:27.870 --> 00:34.280
And then in here I want to create a function to set the text color.

00:34.290 --> 00:39.900
Now the difference between the main difference between a function and a mix in is a function actually

00:39.900 --> 00:46.350
returns something you have to use the return keyword a mix in is just basically a set of styles that

00:46.350 --> 00:47.730
you want to include.

00:47.740 --> 00:48.150
OK.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.620
And I'll I'll I'll give you some examples of this.

00:50.640 --> 00:57.240
So to create a function we use the at symbol and we say function and we're gonna call this set dash

00:57.240 --> 01:03.390
Tex dash color and by the way this is a very helpful function that I use all the time in SAS and it's

01:03.390 --> 01:07.050
going to take in a parameter of a color.

01:07.140 --> 01:07.800
All right.

01:07.980 --> 01:15.300
Now we're gonna use what's called a color function along with a conditional to see the lightness of

01:15.300 --> 01:25.260
the color that's passed in so to create a conditional we do what we do at the ad symbol and then f k

01:25.290 --> 01:27.060
and then our condition goes in here.

01:27.060 --> 01:35.370
So what we're testing is going to be the lightness case we have lightness of the color.

01:36.570 --> 01:36.980
OK.

01:36.990 --> 01:41.970
So basically whatever is passed in here rechecking the lightness and we want to see if it's greater

01:41.970 --> 01:44.030
than 50.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.440
OK so greater than basically 50 percent lightness.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.620
If that's true then we want to return.

01:51.630 --> 01:57.170
So we say at return and we want to return a dark.

01:57.180 --> 01:57.690
I'm sorry.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.030
Yeah dark color which we'll just do black.

02:01.090 --> 02:01.760
OK.

02:01.800 --> 02:13.400
Ls should we need to do at L so forget that at ls then we want to return a light color so we'll do white.

02:13.470 --> 02:18.450
OK so it's going to get passed and the color which is gonna be the background color actually maybe we

02:18.450 --> 02:25.450
should call this the colors fine just know that it's going to be the background color and it's gonna

02:25.490 --> 02:32.160
check the lightness of it if it's greater than 50 meaning it's light then we want to return a dark color

02:32.160 --> 02:37.800
if it's less than 50 meaning it's dark then we want a light color because obviously we want the text

02:37.800 --> 02:48.660
to contrast so I'm going to save this and I'm just going to restart this down here NPM runs SAS and

02:48.660 --> 02:59.830
I'm going to go in to my main dot SPSS and I'm going to import the functions file and then I want to

02:59.870 --> 03:08.850
let's go to the header where we have right here the color of this H1 of this of this will basically

03:08.850 --> 03:17.640
of anything that's in the header and I'm going to replace this with set dash text dash color.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.070
All right.

03:18.070 --> 03:24.700
Now this set text color takes in member a background color and we want to put him whatever we used here

03:24.700 --> 03:29.300
is the background which in this case is dark color so we'll paste that in there.

03:30.850 --> 03:39.910
And now let's save file to import not found or unreached unreachable it's because I called the file

03:39.910 --> 03:42.670
function I actually want to call it functions

03:46.600 --> 03:46.870
all right.

03:46.890 --> 03:51.960
So we're just gonna restart NPM run SAS.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.840
All right so let's reload.

03:54.100 --> 04:01.150
Now it's going to look the same but if I now change the bat the header background to something light

04:01.330 --> 04:10.080
like let's change it to light color and then we pass in the same the light color here and we save the

04:10.080 --> 04:13.230
text is now dark OK.

04:13.310 --> 04:22.660
If I do background primary color primary color it's going to evaluate the lightness of it.

04:22.700 --> 04:27.570
And it found that the lightness is less than 50.

04:27.590 --> 04:35.360
So it gives it a white background secondary color is a brighter color so I'm gonna bet that the text

04:35.360 --> 04:37.280
is going to be dark.

04:37.280 --> 04:42.220
So secondary color for the background and now the text is dark.

04:42.250 --> 04:49.480
So it makes it dynamic so you don't have to if you if you want to change the background then you can

04:49.490 --> 04:53.470
it'll dynamically change the text to whether it should be light or dark.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.090
You don't have to decide that this function does it for you.

04:57.110 --> 04:57.410
All right.

04:57.410 --> 05:02.330
So I'm just going to put this back to dark like that.

05:02.630 --> 05:02.930
All right.

05:02.930 --> 05:07.280
And then I just want to use this sex set text color pretty much everywhere.

05:07.280 --> 05:17.560
So we'll go down here and pay set in and we just want to pass on whatever the background is OK so we'll

05:17.560 --> 05:20.380
do it here as well.

05:22.950 --> 05:27.230
We'll set this to secondary color

05:31.000 --> 05:32.280
and let's do it.

05:32.300 --> 05:36.830
Here this has light color as background.

05:39.780 --> 05:45.730
And then down here this has dark color as a background.

05:46.590 --> 05:49.600
So once I save this it should all still be correct.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.640
So save.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.270
And this actually changed to dark because of the light background.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.320
OK.

05:56.460 --> 05:57.170
And that.

05:57.210 --> 05:57.510
Yeah.

05:57.540 --> 05:58.260
That's it.

05:58.260 --> 06:00.780
So hopefully that makes sense.

06:00.780 --> 06:10.230
Guys it just this is helpful because it allows us to basically set the color dynamically but functions

06:10.230 --> 06:13.860
in general are helpful so that you don't have to keep repeating code.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.350
And so are mixed in.

06:15.360 --> 06:20.510
So now we're going to look at creating a Mixon and all I want this Mixon to do.

06:20.580 --> 06:27.180
We're gonna put it right in the function's file is I want it to add a transform.

06:27.210 --> 06:27.510
OK.

06:27.510 --> 06:34.710
So basically if we want to like you know if we want it to add a transform to make this button curve

06:34.710 --> 06:37.320
or something like that we can do that.

06:37.320 --> 06:43.230
So let's say this is going to be the transform mix in.

06:43.230 --> 06:47.670
And once we start doing this stuff in the next project it'll make more sense as well.

06:47.700 --> 06:54.850
So a Mixon we're gonna say at mix in and then name and I'm just gonna call it transform and it's gonna

06:54.870 --> 06:56.740
take in a property.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.340
OK.

06:59.340 --> 07:08.110
Now in some cases you may want to use prefixes for for newer CSX and that's another good reason to to

07:08.220 --> 07:16.660
use mix ins we can like let's say we wanted to do Web Kit dash transform.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.830
This should be a dash.

07:19.620 --> 07:21.360
So Web Kit transform.

07:21.360 --> 07:28.980
Set it to property and maybe you want to do dash M S dash transform

07:32.530 --> 07:35.690
and set that to property.

07:36.340 --> 07:40.810
And then of course just transform said that to property.

07:41.820 --> 07:42.080
OK.

07:42.100 --> 07:48.520
So if you have a block of styles that you don't want to keep repeating in your first your sass you can

07:48.520 --> 07:50.460
just put it into a mix in.

07:50.470 --> 07:58.360
So now if I want to go back to my main J asked and let's say on the hover state of these buttons I want

07:58.360 --> 08:08.290
to add a transform that rotates them a little bit so I'll go right here and let's put in Ampersand hover

08:10.360 --> 08:19.120
and let's set the mix in now to include a mix and you actually have to do the at include and then the

08:19.120 --> 08:22.210
name of the mix in which is transform.

08:22.850 --> 08:32.420
OK in the property we want to pass in is gonna be lots to rotate and let's rotate it 20 degrees OK and

08:32.440 --> 08:36.960
I'm going to do the same thing for the dark.

08:36.970 --> 08:43.180
So paste that in if it's dark though let's do it let's do negative 20 we'll try to rotate it the opposite

08:43.180 --> 08:43.900
way.

08:43.900 --> 08:48.070
So if I save now and I hover over this you'll see it rotates 20 degrees.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.350
This one rotates that way.

08:50.410 --> 08:50.690
OK.

08:50.710 --> 09:00.130
So instead of using this these three lines in both of these places I can put it in the mix in and just

09:00.130 --> 09:01.030
include that.

09:01.860 --> 09:02.490
OK.

09:02.620 --> 09:07.570
I mean you don't really need web kitten Hamas anymore for transform however.

09:07.670 --> 09:16.810
You know if it's a different if it's a newer CSX property that you do need you know prefixes this is

09:16.810 --> 09:19.090
a good way to include them.

09:19.160 --> 09:19.440
OK.

09:19.460 --> 09:26.140
And not just for prefixes but for anything any set of styles that you're going to reuse.

09:26.140 --> 09:33.280
So let's see the last thing I want to show you is some of the color functions we have lighting and darken

09:33.550 --> 09:39.810
let's say in addition to just tilting these we want them to either darken our light in a little bit.

09:40.480 --> 09:47.350
So in the hover here I'm going to set the background dash color.

09:47.890 --> 09:52.990
So the background color is is this light color by default let's say I just want to darken it a little

09:52.990 --> 09:57.220
bit so we can say darken.

09:58.070 --> 09:59.770
So this is a predefined function.

09:59.770 --> 10:00.990
I don't have to create it.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.880
And we just pass in two things the color we want.

10:04.030 --> 10:07.610
So we'll say light color and then how much we want to darken it.

10:07.620 --> 10:08.890
We're going to do 10 percent.

10:09.640 --> 10:09.870
OK.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.810
So save that.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.280
Now when I hover over it.

10:12.430 --> 10:14.710
Notice that the color darkens 10 percent.

10:15.850 --> 10:16.150
OK.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.200
We also have light.

10:17.200 --> 10:23.950
So I'm going to just copy what I just did go down here to this hover and let's change this to lighten

10:25.340 --> 10:27.470
ups lighten.

10:27.910 --> 10:32.200
And this has the dark color and we're going to lighten it 10 percent.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.040
So we'll save.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.530
And then on a hover over it you'll see that at lightning 10 percent.

10:37.660 --> 10:37.930
All right.

10:37.930 --> 10:43.120
So you can see that there's some really cool functionality with SAS it really allows us to write our

10:43.130 --> 10:49.870
CSX more like a programming language conditionals you can't do this stuff with standard CSX premade

10:49.870 --> 10:57.100
functions and mix ins you can do variables however you can see that the variables with SAS are much

10:57.100 --> 10:57.890
more elegant.

10:57.890 --> 11:02.590
You know you don't have to do the VAR in the parentheses and you know stuff like that.

11:02.590 --> 11:02.910
All right.

11:02.910 --> 11:09.190
So hopefully this little crash course or the sandbox made sense in the next video we're going to start

11:09.190 --> 11:14.770
to build a real project using SAS which will be a portfolio Web site.

11:14.770 --> 11:15.030
All right.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.950
So I will see you in the next project.
