00:00.470 --> 00:05.400
All right guys so in the last video I showed you how to implement CSX in a few different ways.

00:05.520 --> 00:11.910
And the most common way is going to be by using an external style sheet like style dot CSX and then

00:11.910 --> 00:14.640
bringing it in using the link tag.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.940
But like I said for the sandbox for this section I'm going to be using internal CSX in a style tag just

00:20.940 --> 00:25.100
so we have everything on one page just for the sake of learning.

00:25.140 --> 00:33.900
OK so let's create a new file here and we're going to call this zero to underscore selectors dot each

00:33.900 --> 00:34.500
team out.

00:35.190 --> 00:41.100
Because what I want to talk about is the different ways that we can select content to style or select

00:41.130 --> 00:43.470
elements or tags to style.

00:43.470 --> 00:51.810
So let's put in our boilerplate here with VSO code and let's call the CSX selectors

00:54.880 --> 00:58.540
and we're going to put in some style tags here.

00:59.350 --> 01:07.060
OK and then as far as the body I'm going to just put in some simple aged him l will have a div and inside

01:07.060 --> 01:09.620
this div let's do an H two.

01:09.820 --> 01:14.350
We'll just say welcome and paragraph.

01:14.350 --> 01:26.470
Let's do Lorem 20 tab and then let's do another div and we'll do another H two and we'll say about paragraph

01:27.100 --> 01:29.170
Lorem 20 tab.

01:29.650 --> 01:29.870
OK.

01:29.910 --> 01:33.300
So let's save this and let's open it up with live server.

01:33.670 --> 01:39.220
If you're using live server so we have two divs with heading in a paragraph.

01:39.220 --> 01:45.040
Now in the last video we took an H two and we gave it a color.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.070
Let's go ahead and do that.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.980
We'll see green.

01:48.270 --> 01:54.550
And if I save that what happens is it's going to take every single each to on the page and style it

01:54.550 --> 01:55.910
green.

01:56.010 --> 02:01.930
Now there's gonna be cases where you don't want every single element whatever that element is to be

02:02.000 --> 02:05.710
styled you want to pick and choose what you want to style like.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.780
Let's say we only want this this one this first one to be green.

02:09.910 --> 02:12.150
In that case we would use an idea or a class.

02:12.160 --> 02:23.740
So if I were to add Ida green dash heading I could go up here and I could add onto this age to a no

02:23.740 --> 02:29.680
sign which represents an I.D. and then the name of the I.D. and I could have called it called it absolutely

02:29.680 --> 02:33.690
anything if I save that notice only the first one is green.

02:34.200 --> 02:34.560
OK.

02:34.570 --> 02:37.120
Because it's targeting this I.D..

02:37.420 --> 02:42.590
Now this is actually optional we don't have to put the actual element.

02:42.910 --> 02:48.700
However if we keep it off like that we could add this green heading idea to anything and it would be

02:48.700 --> 02:54.040
in effect if I added to a paragraph it would turn the paragraph color green although that wouldn't make

02:54.040 --> 03:00.160
much sense because we call the green heading but for the most part you're not gonna see the actual element

03:00.670 --> 03:02.620
at least in my experience.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.740
Now remember what I said about classes and I.D. This is not really something I would put inside of an

03:08.740 --> 03:14.890
I.D. because it doesn't really for one thing we might want to use this again we might want another green

03:14.890 --> 03:19.880
heading somewhere an I.D. should be something that there's only one of.

03:19.960 --> 03:25.170
So I would actually change this to a class and then to target a class.

03:25.330 --> 03:30.700
The styling is the same way it's just this right here instead of a number sine you want a dot.

03:30.730 --> 03:33.130
So if I save that notice it's still green.

03:33.250 --> 03:33.500
OK.

03:33.520 --> 03:45.250
So just remember no sign is for I.D. dot is for classes and I'm just going to comment this stuff out

03:45.870 --> 03:51.160
just so you have just you have some reference and I'll do an I.D. and I'll I'll add that as well later

03:51.160 --> 03:52.500
on.

03:52.510 --> 03:56.490
So now what I want to do is talk a little bit about naming conventions.

03:56.620 --> 04:01.780
This is not really a good name because at any point we might want to change this to a different color

04:01.780 --> 04:06.260
like blue maybe maybe it's a Web site for a company and they change their branding.

04:06.400 --> 04:13.390
So if I save that it's now blue and then this this heading or I'm sorry this this title here the class

04:13.390 --> 04:15.140
name makes no sense.

04:15.190 --> 04:21.070
So what I would do is I'd call this something like primary heading instead of green heading.

04:21.070 --> 04:21.430
OK.

04:21.430 --> 04:27.730
That way it's just your primary color your or your headings primary color you mean it might even have

04:27.730 --> 04:32.800
a secondary heading class if you want a different color and it doesn't have to just be color you could

04:32.800 --> 04:38.610
change the font size whatever it is that you want but you want to think about your naming conventions.

04:38.680 --> 04:38.980
OK.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.380
And you want to think about the future.

04:40.390 --> 04:45.910
Could this change in the future so calling it green heading is not really a good choice even though

04:45.910 --> 04:48.370
it's it's going to work.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.990
It's just it doesn't it's not it's not a smart choice semantically.

04:52.990 --> 04:53.320
All right.

04:53.350 --> 05:03.160
So now what I want to do is see let's add an I.D. to these divs so we'll call this one welcome and let's

05:03.160 --> 05:06.160
call this one about.

05:06.480 --> 05:06.930
OK.

05:06.940 --> 05:12.430
So you see all this makes sense because we're not going to have another welcome Dev or another about

05:12.430 --> 05:13.080
div.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.490
So an I.D. is a good choice for this.

05:16.510 --> 05:25.450
So if I wanted to let's say let's say give the welcome idea background color I could target it like

05:25.480 --> 05:27.920
this.

05:28.070 --> 05:28.850
All right.

05:28.860 --> 05:35.470
And I'll say background or background color and don't worry about any of these properties I don't want

05:35.470 --> 05:38.230
you to focus on these because we're going to talk about all of these later.

05:38.230 --> 05:41.170
I just I want you to focus on the selectors.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.900
So I'm going to give this a background color of a hexadecimal value that's actually a light gray.

05:47.050 --> 05:51.660
So if I save that notice that this only has that background color.

05:51.790 --> 06:03.850
So let me put a comment here and say no sign is for I.D. Now what if I want to have some styling but

06:03.850 --> 06:07.060
I want it for both of these divs right here.

06:07.150 --> 06:07.480
OK.

06:07.510 --> 06:14.050
So if we want to do that we can use multiple selectors.

06:14.740 --> 06:17.010
So what I'll do is I'll take the welcome.

06:17.460 --> 06:17.670
OK.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.110
The div with the idea of welcome.

06:20.230 --> 06:25.710
Put a comma and then put the div with the idea of a bow and then put my styling.

06:25.720 --> 06:31.890
So let's say I want to give them a border of one pixel solid.

06:31.890 --> 06:35.250
Do you like gray.

06:35.320 --> 06:41.200
I'm going to talk about these numbers probably in the next video or the one after that and then I also

06:41.200 --> 06:48.580
want to add a little bit of padding and margin bottom of five pixels.

06:48.580 --> 06:48.870
All right.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.110
So going to save that.

06:50.110 --> 06:56.350
And that style was now it was applied to both of these divs because I used multiple selectors and I

06:56.350 --> 07:02.560
could add more if I want doesn't have to be I.D. I could put an H to I could put a paragraph I could

07:02.560 --> 07:08.040
put a class whatever I want and that would take on all of these styles in here.

07:08.750 --> 07:09.870
OK.

07:10.150 --> 07:17.440
Now let's say I wanted to target a specific for instance a specific paragraph inside of a specific div

07:18.070 --> 07:20.050
like let's say the welcome paragraph.

07:20.050 --> 07:22.600
I want that font size to be bigger.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.500
What I could do is I could use a nested selector

07:29.410 --> 07:34.670
by saying D welcome and then space paragraph.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.970
You don't want to do a comma what that means is is it means all the divs or all the elements with the

07:39.970 --> 07:42.520
idea of welcome in all paragraphs.

07:42.520 --> 07:49.240
You don't want that comma because we want to say inside the the element of welcome we want the paragraph

07:49.240 --> 07:50.780
inside of it.

07:51.210 --> 07:51.630
OK.

07:51.640 --> 07:59.400
And then let's say font size we'll do 20 pixels by the way 16 is the default.

07:59.410 --> 08:02.100
But I'll talk about pixels and all that and a little bit.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.100
So I save that.

08:03.100 --> 08:10.900
Notice that only the welcome div paragraph has the font size of 20.

08:10.930 --> 08:11.330
All right.

08:11.330 --> 08:15.940
So let's see what else we can also style the body.

08:15.940 --> 08:23.200
So if we go up here say body styling.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.020
So we'll take.

08:26.020 --> 08:31.720
Body and body is usually where you put lye if you want the whole Web site or the whole web page to have

08:31.720 --> 08:32.740
a background color.

08:32.740 --> 08:36.780
You could do that.

08:36.980 --> 08:40.820
I'm going to give it a hexadecimal of three three three which is a dark gray.

08:40.870 --> 08:42.090
So if I save that you'll see it.

08:42.090 --> 08:44.250
It changes the whole body.

08:44.260 --> 08:50.500
Now the reason we can't read this right here is because by default the text is black.

08:50.500 --> 09:01.330
So what I'll do is I'll go to I'll just target the about the div with the bow and I'll change the color

09:01.330 --> 09:07.190
which is the text color to white so that we can see it.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.010
OK.

09:08.030 --> 09:14.150
And I know this is pretty ugly looking but I just want you to know the different types of ways to basically

09:14.150 --> 09:17.580
select and style different elements.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.020
OK.

09:18.020 --> 09:21.020
So instead of body styling I'm just going to say element

09:23.990 --> 09:24.740
selector

09:27.350 --> 09:28.020
OK.

09:28.460 --> 09:33.410
Because we're grabbing the actual element or the actual tag when I say element.

09:33.410 --> 09:41.810
I just mean tag the body itself is the element div is the element H2 is the element with the angle brackets

09:41.840 --> 09:42.590
is a tag.

09:42.590 --> 09:45.340
So I use them interchangeably.

09:45.410 --> 09:45.710
All right.

09:45.740 --> 09:57.460
So we have elements or selectors just make this consistent here elements selectors dot is for classes

09:57.520 --> 10:04.780
number for I.D. We have multiple selectors by using a comma we have nested selectors we can select stuff

10:04.840 --> 10:09.130
inside of other elements and those that's pretty much the basics.

10:09.160 --> 10:13.960
I mean we have other things like pseudo selectors and and stuff like that but I'm not going to get into

10:13.960 --> 10:20.230
that now I just want you to understand the fundamentals of selecting elements and being able to style

10:20.230 --> 10:21.040
them.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.630
All right so that's it guys.

10:22.630 --> 10:24.010
I will see you in the next video.
