00:00.270 --> 00:06.510
All right guys now I'm going to show you how to take a grid item and span it across multiple rows and

00:06.510 --> 00:07.530
columns.

00:07.530 --> 00:14.030
So we're gonna create a new file here called 0 3 underscore grid underscore span dot HD CML.

00:14.490 --> 00:24.390
And let's go ahead and generate our each team I'll head body tags we'll say grid span style

00:27.910 --> 00:36.560
and as far as the markup let's just do our parent call it grid and then let's do class item just say

00:36.560 --> 00:41.940
item money Sign and let's do a bunch of them so we'll do times 15.

00:42.350 --> 00:54.410
So have 15 grid items here so let's say grid display grid and then I'm going to add grid template columns

00:54.740 --> 01:02.170
and I'm going to just do a repeat of 4 1 f fa items.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.250
OK so we'll save that.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.480
Let's open it up.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.600
All right it's gonna look like that.

01:07.610 --> 01:14.180
I'm just gonna grab the styling of the item from one of the other files just so we can clearly see see

01:14.180 --> 01:17.500
them as boxes.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.190
Why is this not copying

01:22.300 --> 01:22.670
all right.

01:22.810 --> 01:23.920
So save that.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.850
Good.

01:24.880 --> 01:31.330
Now what I want to do is take one of these items we'll take the first one and I want to show you how

01:31.330 --> 01:39.370
we can span it across okay across the columns and also down through the rows.

01:39.370 --> 01:42.790
So I want to take this item one and I want to have it go like this.

01:42.790 --> 01:48.320
Fill up this whole area and basically push the rest over so we can do that using.

01:48.370 --> 01:52.320
I want to show you kind of a long way first and then I'll show you a short away.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.750
So let's first target this first item.

01:55.750 --> 01:59.880
We could give it a special class but well let's just use our pseudo selectors.

01:59.890 --> 02:01.080
We'll use first child.

02:01.090 --> 02:02.230
So I'll say.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.850
Class of item.

02:03.860 --> 02:14.050
We want the first child and we have a property called GRID column start.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.710
OK so we can specify where we want it to start.

02:17.710 --> 02:18.960
In terms of the columns.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.330
So it starts at 1 right now.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.770
Let's say let's just put it to two and save.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.050
And you can see that it gets pushed over.

02:26.070 --> 02:26.330
OK.

02:26.350 --> 02:32.500
So we can start at wherever we want but I'm going to started at 1 and then I'm going to use another

02:32.500 --> 02:35.000
property called GRID column end.

02:35.180 --> 02:41.940
And we can basically tell it where we want it to end and I'm going to put in here for.

02:43.210 --> 02:47.650
And you can see what happens is it spanned across what looks like three.

02:47.650 --> 02:55.560
But what you're going to do is you're going to look at the lines Casey of one two three four.

02:55.610 --> 02:56.080
OK.

02:56.140 --> 03:00.240
So if you use this grid column and start now and that's what you're going to look at is you're going

03:00.240 --> 03:02.350
to count these lines.

03:02.410 --> 03:09.310
Now we can also go down and that's that's the big difference between the grid and flex box or one of

03:09.310 --> 03:15.550
them is that you can't do that with Flex blocks you have your rows and that's it with with the grid

03:15.550 --> 03:20.050
we can we can be multi-dimensional and we can span this down into the next one.

03:20.500 --> 03:30.760
So let's add grid dash row dash start and we'll start at 1 which is where we currently are.

03:30.760 --> 03:40.090
And then let's say grid dash row dash and and let's say we want to end at three and I'm going to save

03:40.090 --> 03:40.460
that.

03:40.480 --> 03:47.740
And now you can see that this is now spanning basically Well look what looks like two rows.

03:47.740 --> 03:54.040
But again if you look at the lines it's going from one to three.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.740
Now this is kind of a long way to do this.

03:56.740 --> 04:00.270
There's a shorter way much like with many things and CSX.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.170
So I'm going to comment this out and I'm going to show you how to do the same thing by using the grid

04:05.170 --> 04:08.700
column in the grid row property rather than starting.

04:08.710 --> 04:12.340
And so let's say grid dash column.

04:12.340 --> 04:18.670
So it's basically just a shortcut and we're gonna say start at 1 and then we want to do a slash and

04:18.670 --> 04:21.120
we want to span three.

04:21.250 --> 04:26.130
So I save that you can see it's doing the same thing that these two lines are doing.

04:26.170 --> 04:31.480
And even though I put four here when I put three it does the same thing because here we're saying we

04:31.480 --> 04:37.870
want to take we want an item to start at 1 and go to 4 when here we're saying we're taking item 1 and

04:37.870 --> 04:39.680
spanning it 3.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.080
OK.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.610
And item one is here.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.370
So we're spanning three.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.780
Now if we want to go down like we did before.

04:46.780 --> 04:54.650
Down down a row we can do grid row and let's start at one.

04:54.750 --> 04:58.950
And we want to span two and we'll save.

04:58.970 --> 05:00.950
And we get the same result.

05:00.950 --> 05:01.250
OK.

05:01.260 --> 05:05.110
So this is just a shorter way of doing this.

05:05.190 --> 05:06.180
Let's grab another one.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.810
So let's let's get a random one we'll just take nine.

05:09.960 --> 05:19.470
So we'll use and the child so we'll say item and let's say andthe child and we'll do nine

05:22.580 --> 05:28.390
and I want to keep it in its place but span it across all the way to the end here.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.300
So in terms of columns it's in the second column.

05:32.300 --> 05:32.570
Right.

05:32.570 --> 05:38.620
So we want to do grid dash column and we want to set to.

05:38.630 --> 05:45.300
We want to start at 2 and then we want to span 2.

05:45.380 --> 05:45.770
OK.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.250
We'll go ahead and save that actually wanted to go all the way over so we want to spend three.

05:50.270 --> 05:50.540
All right.

05:50.540 --> 05:56.680
And then if we want to span it down we could do grid row

05:59.480 --> 06:00.650
and let's start it.

06:00.710 --> 06:04.540
So we're at 1 2 3 4.

06:05.330 --> 06:12.830
So let's say start at 4 and let's span 2 and save.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.440
And now it gets pushed down.

06:14.450 --> 06:15.180
OK.

06:15.320 --> 06:22.910
So I mean you can start it wherever you want like we could do grid row 2 and span 2 and it's going to

06:22.910 --> 06:25.190
get it's going to get pushed up here.

06:25.280 --> 06:25.640
All right.

06:25.640 --> 06:32.540
And notice that it's completely out of order but you may want that you may you may want your markup

06:32.540 --> 06:39.590
to be a certain way but you want to move the the element visually without changing your markup.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.780
So the grid is good for that as well.

06:41.780 --> 06:42.050
All right.

06:42.050 --> 06:46.490
So in the next video we're going to take a look at auto fitting and min max.
