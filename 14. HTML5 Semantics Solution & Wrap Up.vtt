00:00.670 --> 00:06.690
All right guys so in the last video I gave you a little challenge I wanted you to replace the certain

00:06.690 --> 00:15.450
divs with each team of five semantic tags to just make it more accessible more organized.

00:15.450 --> 00:19.230
And I did the first one for you which is the div with the idea of header.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.570
So we use the header tag here.

00:21.570 --> 00:24.620
So the next one is pretty obvious.

00:24.630 --> 00:27.630
We have a div with the idea of main that goes around.

00:27.630 --> 00:33.390
Let's take a look at the project goes around all of this area which is basically the main content of

00:33.390 --> 00:34.460
the page.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.940
So that would be replaced with the main tag.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.620
So this ends.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.830
Like I said you can click on a div and it ends here.

00:44.850 --> 00:47.490
So we want to change the ending div.

00:47.510 --> 00:52.740
And we want to change the starting div.

00:52.740 --> 00:52.980
OK.

00:53.050 --> 00:54.450
So that's the first one.

00:54.450 --> 01:00.260
Next one is gonna be in here we have the welcome section which ends right here.

01:00.270 --> 01:03.820
So this this is actually going to be a section.

01:03.960 --> 01:04.250
OK.

01:04.260 --> 01:08.350
So we're gonna change that and we're going to change that to Section.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.570
Next we have the blog section.

01:10.590 --> 01:18.500
Now this ends right here so we're gonna change this section and change that section.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.600
Now within the blog we have some articles.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.430
So did with the class of article.

01:23.420 --> 01:28.700
So these are gonna be changed to article I'm going to cover.

01:28.770 --> 01:32.900
I'm going to select the div right here and then do a controlled D.

01:32.910 --> 01:35.310
I'm also going to get the next one and the next one.

01:35.370 --> 01:35.600
OK.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.130
So just some shortcuts here.

01:37.140 --> 01:44.150
We're gonna change all of these to article OK so the next thing is the sidebar.

01:44.150 --> 01:49.790
Now remember a site is for content that's not the main content but it's on the page we have navigation

01:49.790 --> 01:51.600
we have contact stuff here.

01:51.680 --> 01:58.820
So we're gonna grab this div right here along with the ending div and put in a side.

01:58.820 --> 02:06.380
Now the well the way that NAV works is we don't actually replace the well we wrap the L and NAV tags

02:06.410 --> 02:14.570
so let's say oops let's do NAV and then we'll grab this and I'll just hold option or alter and then

02:14.570 --> 02:18.240
the upper key and just move it up into the nav.

02:18.240 --> 02:18.980
Okay.

02:19.070 --> 02:26.480
And then the last thing is going to be the footer which I want to replace the div here with footer and

02:26.480 --> 02:31.250
let's save and if we take a look at the result it looks the exact same.

02:31.250 --> 02:31.600
All right.

02:31.600 --> 02:37.460
So if any of what we've talked about has been confusing don't worry about it we're gonna be doing this

02:37.460 --> 02:40.220
stuff all along throughout the course.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.760
So you're going to get the hang of it.

02:41.960 --> 02:47.030
If what we've talked about has been painfully easy for you Don't worry about it.

02:47.030 --> 02:49.460
Things are going to get more complicated.

02:49.460 --> 02:55.070
I just want to start from absolute scratch for people that that have never even written a paragraph

02:55.070 --> 02:56.100
tag before.

02:56.150 --> 03:03.050
So hopefully hopefully both sides are somewhat satisfied hopefully that you're you're starting to get

03:03.050 --> 03:09.500
it if you're an absolute beginner and hope flat and bore you to death if your more advanced front end

03:09.500 --> 03:10.540
developer.

03:10.580 --> 03:10.870
All right.

03:10.900 --> 03:16.190
So in the next video or I'm sorry in the next section we're going to jump in to see assess basics.

03:16.190 --> 03:22.550
So we're going to start to talk about all the basic properties for colors and padding and margin and

03:22.820 --> 03:24.230
the box model.

03:24.230 --> 03:31.100
We're going to look at things like positioning different types of positioning relative absolute and

03:31.100 --> 03:32.080
a whole bunch of other stuff.

03:32.090 --> 03:33.660
So that's it.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.110
I'll see you in the next section.
