All right guys so in the last video we created our hamburger menu here we have the checkbox.

00:05.820 --> 00:09.960
We can actually check and uncheck but we can't really visually see that right now.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.650
What I do want to happen is when we check I want the I want the lines here to turn into an x.

00:15.750 --> 00:19.820
So we're gonna be utilizing transform and rotate.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.840
So let's go down.

00:21.840 --> 00:29.280
Here in menu dot CSX and let's say toggle or animation.

00:29.280 --> 00:37.670
So basically we want to take our toggles which is our checkbox and we can target the state of checked.

00:37.670 --> 00:37.940
OK.

00:37.950 --> 00:43.160
So this style will only be in effect when it's actually checked.

00:43.170 --> 00:49.670
Now I want to manipulate the div inside the hamburger which is the lines right.

00:50.040 --> 00:57.240
So we're going to say plus when we looked at the plus selector a little while ago and we want to choose

00:57.240 --> 01:07.680
the hamburger class and then the directive and that's what we want to transform so we're gonna say transform

01:07.710 --> 01:17.190
and we want to rotate and let's rotate one hundred and thirty five degrees and save and now if I click

01:17.190 --> 01:23.040
this you'll see that it rotates 135 degrees and obviously that's not all we want to happen.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.240
We want this to turn into an x.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.450
So we have to target the before and after as well.

01:30.570 --> 01:33.990
So let's actually copy this

01:36.830 --> 01:37.580
and

01:40.080 --> 01:49.080
let's do colon before and then comma and I'm gonna paste this in again and we're gonna do after as well.

01:49.530 --> 01:58.490
And let's set this to be from the top zero and then we want to add a transform for these of 90 degrees.

01:59.040 --> 02:09.120
So we won't transform rotate and we wanted to rotate these 90 degrees and we'll go ahead and save and

02:09.120 --> 02:15.630
click and it's doing exactly what we wanted to do except it's not transitioning and the reason for that

02:15.630 --> 02:20.830
is I actually forgot to put transition on the the hamburger div.

02:20.830 --> 02:31.410
So up here we want to add in transition and we'll say all and let's say zero point four seconds and

02:31.410 --> 02:32.400
we'll ease.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.050
So let's save that.

02:34.050 --> 02:38.430
Now when we click it it actually spins and has a transition.

02:38.430 --> 02:51.180
Now I just want to put a comment in here and we'll just say that this turns the lines into X hey again

02:51.180 --> 02:53.460
just so you know what does what.

02:53.460 --> 03:00.550
This one right here moves lying down.

03:01.440 --> 03:08.220
And another thing that I want is when it's checked like that right now that the inputs checked that's

03:08.220 --> 03:10.290
how this is happening when it's checked.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.850
If I hover over this I wanted to kind of just spin back in the form of I'm on it.

03:14.850 --> 03:22.050
And then if I go off spin back again so we can go down here and let's just say rotate

03:24.330 --> 03:29.110
rotate on hover when checked.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.050
So we're going to target

03:34.620 --> 03:37.300
menu and cheeses.

03:37.350 --> 03:47.790
Can't type menu wrap and then toddler and we're gonna say when it's checked when we hover then we want

03:47.850 --> 03:51.170
the hamburger div.

03:51.180 --> 03:58.250
So we just want to do class hamburger div.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.870
We want that to rotate.

03:59.880 --> 04:09.570
So we'll say transform and let's say rotate and let's rotate it two to five degrees.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.050
All right.

04:10.080 --> 04:17.890
So now if I check it it's checked right now and if I hover over it it will rotate and twenty five degrees

04:18.370 --> 04:20.300
close it up.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.340
So this is this is giving us the exact effect that we want.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.260
OK.

04:25.270 --> 04:29.570
So now what we want to do is move on to the menu itself.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.450
These links here.

04:31.450 --> 04:32.910
We want those too.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.270
We don't want those to be visible at first and then we when we click this we want those to show up and

04:37.270 --> 04:39.830
we want to add that overlay in that style.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.800
So that's all we're going to get to in the next video.
