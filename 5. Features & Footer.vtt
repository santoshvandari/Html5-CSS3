WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:04.590
All right guys so now we're going to jump back into our aged e-mail and we're going to add the three

00:04.590 --> 00:11.490
boxes when what I mean is this right here this location meals and fitness room these features OK so

00:11.490 --> 00:17.460
I'm going to give this a section with the idea of features and then each one is going to be a div and

00:17.460 --> 00:21.990
I'm going to give it a class of box and we're going to style that both those boxes.

00:21.990 --> 00:26.720
So let's go down below our last section which was the home info.

00:26.970 --> 00:33.780
And again if you watch me build Web sites and themes like I said I usually have a header and then I'll

00:33.780 --> 00:35.370
build on each section.

00:36.150 --> 00:41.310
And if you if you take my bootstrap class bootstrap course on you to me I do the same exact thing it

00:41.310 --> 00:45.970
doesn't matter if I'm using a framework or from using just each team all five.

00:46.110 --> 00:49.410
So what's to section.

00:49.410 --> 00:58.380
And let's give this an I.D. of features OK and within this feature section we're gonna have three boxes.

00:58.380 --> 00:59.940
So I'm actually going to do.

00:59.960 --> 01:08.010
Let's do dot box and let's use our image trick of doing asterisk three enter a tab and it'll give us

01:08.010 --> 01:10.740
three divs of the class of box.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.870
So inside here we're gonna have the icon.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.420
I'm gonna get to that after.

01:14.520 --> 01:24.810
So let's just skip the icon for now and let's do an h three and let's say great location and then we're

01:24.810 --> 01:32.880
gonna have a paragraph which is gonna have I believe 10 words to do last 10 like that and then we want

01:32.880 --> 01:36.660
the same thing inside these two boxes.

01:36.660 --> 01:44.400
So we'll paste that in there in there and let's just change the heading for the second one to three

01:44.880 --> 01:45.660
meals

01:49.040 --> 01:52.910
and then the third one is going to be fitness room.

01:55.510 --> 01:56.160
OK.

01:56.180 --> 02:00.760
So just a list of what the amount and these features will save that.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.610
Let's go down.

02:01.610 --> 02:04.010
So it's going to look like this by default.

02:04.010 --> 02:07.100
Now before you get to the CSF let's add the icons.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.070
Now these icons come from font.

02:09.110 --> 02:09.710
Awesome.

02:09.710 --> 02:19.610
So if we go to font awesome font awesome dot com and go to start using free it's going to give us a

02:19.610 --> 02:25.670
link tag that goes to this all dot CSF style sheet which allows us to use those fonts.

02:25.730 --> 02:32.090
So we just want to double click this and copy it's going to control C and then let's paste it up top

02:32.090 --> 02:37.280
here above our link so control V will paste that in.

02:37.520 --> 02:43.760
And now since we have this included we can use certain classes that will give us certain icons.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.010
Now if the font awesome Web site allows us to search for icons so building I actually want to search

02:49.010 --> 02:53.890
for a hotel and it's going to give us some results.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.940
Now there is a pro version to find awesome I believe it's like 50 dollars a year.

02:58.940 --> 03:05.000
I'm not sure I don't have the pro subscription but usually the first one see how there's three hotels

03:05.000 --> 03:11.150
three a squares usually the first one is free and then these ones as you can see have the little pro

03:11.150 --> 03:12.830
icon.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.770
So we want this first one this first hotel I'm going to click on it and what we want to look at here

03:19.100 --> 03:22.140
it shows us the icon different sizes and stuff.

03:22.430 --> 03:28.640
But what we want to look at is this tag this I tag with this class and you're gonna have two classes

03:28.670 --> 03:33.650
you're going to have one that's just the font awesome class and then you have one that is the actual

03:34.250 --> 03:37.030
what the icon is in this case it's the hotel.

03:37.160 --> 03:43.130
So we can actually just click it and it copies it for us and then we can go back into our hmo.

03:43.130 --> 03:51.700
Let's go right above this H3 and paste that in let's bring that over and we'll save it and let's go

03:51.700 --> 03:54.370
back to our page here and notice.

03:54.370 --> 03:56.920
Now we have a little hotel icon.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.450
Now this is too small.

03:58.990 --> 04:05.020
We could change the font size after all it is a font but there's actually classes that we can use to

04:05.020 --> 04:06.360
change the size.

04:06.400 --> 04:15.370
So if we add in a class here of F A Dash three X Casey of 2 x to 3 to 5 x I believe and it will change.

04:15.370 --> 04:17.410
It'll basically be three times as big.

04:17.410 --> 04:19.410
So let's save it and go back.

04:19.420 --> 04:22.640
And now we have a much bigger icon.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.390
OK so the other icons we want.

04:25.420 --> 04:30.610
I'm just going to copy this eye tag here and we're going to paste one in right above free meals.

04:30.610 --> 04:33.730
This one is called FAA utensils

04:36.950 --> 04:37.310
OK.

04:37.320 --> 04:44.350
So if we went and searched for whatever food it will show us the utensils icon and then this one here

04:44.350 --> 04:47.000
is F A Dash dumbbell.

04:49.420 --> 04:49.780
OK.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.340
Let's save that and take a look.

04:51.340 --> 04:56.800
And now we have our three icons so that's it for the H team out for this part.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.810
Now let's style it.

04:57.820 --> 05:04.150
So we're going to go to style CSX and let's go down to the bottom here

05:06.850 --> 05:10.450
so we want to do our features section

05:13.240 --> 05:15.770
which is basically just the bark or we could do a

05:19.960 --> 05:24.570
I'm trying to think if we are going to we're going to use these boxes anywhere else.

05:24.570 --> 05:27.130
I don't think so.

05:27.240 --> 05:31.080
I mean you could use the box as a utility class if you were gonna use them.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.230
Actually yeah let's just do dock box in case we use them somewhere else.

05:38.040 --> 05:42.450
So each box we're gonna float left.

05:43.050 --> 05:47.460
Even though you know they're all gonna be in a row it's not like a left and a right.

05:47.490 --> 05:47.860
We aren't.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.520
We want them all to flow left just like we do with the menu items with the list items.

05:52.560 --> 06:00.420
It'll make them go horizontal and then the width we're gonna set to thirty three point three percent.

06:00.630 --> 06:01.380
OK.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.730
Because we want them to be I want them to all be even and there's three of them.

06:05.940 --> 06:09.380
And then for padding let's do 50 pixels.

06:09.420 --> 06:17.910
And since we have border box up here as us value for box sizing since we put that there this padding

06:17.910 --> 06:19.600
will not get added to the width.

06:19.620 --> 06:24.830
If you don't put the ball in a box then it's gonna get added and it's not going to look right.

06:26.100 --> 06:26.410
Okay.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.360
And then the last thing is they just want to align everything to the center.

06:30.600 --> 06:38.370
So text align center and let's save that and take a look.

06:38.370 --> 06:38.670
Good.

06:38.670 --> 06:43.080
So now everything is aligned horizontally.

06:43.230 --> 06:47.810
I do want to add a margin bottom to the actual I tag to the icon.

06:47.940 --> 06:58.650
So let's say dot box I and let's say margin dash bottom 10 pixels.

06:58.850 --> 06:59.340
OK.

06:59.340 --> 07:05.130
Now for the background remember we have those utility classes the big classes.

07:05.130 --> 07:13.950
So instead of coloring you know adding box or whatever we're gonna grab on to those classes and put

07:13.950 --> 07:15.240
them in our each team.

07:15.300 --> 07:21.840
So this first div with the class of box I wanted to have a light background so I'm gonna add BJP light

07:22.290 --> 07:24.980
and we've already I added the style for these.

07:25.110 --> 07:33.970
The second one is gonna be BJP dash primary because we wanted to be that tan color and then the last

07:33.970 --> 07:39.430
one again is BJP dash light and save

07:42.300 --> 07:42.640
okay.

07:42.650 --> 07:45.080
So it looks like I made a mistake earlier.

07:45.080 --> 07:51.230
I think I put the the color as tan here for BJP primary where it should be on the background not the

07:51.230 --> 07:52.130
color.

07:52.130 --> 07:56.150
So let's head back up to big primary

07:58.930 --> 08:00.370
and where is it.

08:00.370 --> 08:00.580
Yeah.

08:00.610 --> 08:11.310
Right here BJP primary so the background should be this not that and then let's see the color

08:14.970 --> 08:19.930
should be that I believe or is the color whites we check.

08:20.040 --> 08:20.920
No that's right.

08:22.020 --> 08:25.430
But let's just move background to the top like that.

08:25.480 --> 08:25.740
All right.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.130
So let's save.

08:27.220 --> 08:31.090
And now the background is the color not the actual text.

08:31.170 --> 08:31.440
OK.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.500
So that looks pretty good.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.580
Now we want to do the footer.

08:34.990 --> 08:40.410
So let's head back to our each team Al and remember we have a semantic each team of five footer tags.

08:40.420 --> 08:49.090
So right under this section let's do footer and I'm actually going to give it an I.D. of main footer

08:52.300 --> 08:58.060
and the reason for this is because you may have you can have photos in other play it doesn't have to

08:58.060 --> 09:03.400
mean a Web site photo like a page photo or it could be a photo or two let's say an article maybe you

09:03.400 --> 09:08.290
have articles where you have a head a header and then you have a footer at the bottom with maybe the

09:08.290 --> 09:10.140
author's name and stuff like that.

09:10.270 --> 09:15.780
So you don't always have to think of headers and footers as page headers and footers.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.510
So let's put a paragraph in here and let's just say hotel

09:21.860 --> 09:24.180
Beattie let's do our copyright entity.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.130
So Ampersand copy semicolon.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.330
We'll do 20 19.

09:30.330 --> 09:35.230
All rights reserved.

09:35.230 --> 09:36.600
OK let's save that.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.790
So by default it's going to look like this.

09:38.790 --> 09:41.290
We need to add a little bit of styling.

09:41.950 --> 09:48.410
So go back to our style sheet and let's grab on to the main footer.

09:48.470 --> 09:51.940
Let's put a comment in here and we'll say.

09:52.020 --> 09:56.250
Main dash footer.

09:56.250 --> 10:01.930
And first of all I want to align everything to the center.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.060
OK.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.470
We're going to add a background.

10:04.470 --> 10:05.150
Actually no.

10:05.180 --> 10:09.420
You know what we'll do is we'll use the big dark on the footer.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.490
Wait a minute.

10:10.530 --> 10:15.770
No we're not going to do that because we want it to be a little lighter than the big dark.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.520
So we actually will out a background

10:20.410 --> 10:23.320
let's do four for four which is a shade lighter.

10:25.380 --> 10:25.680
OK.

10:25.690 --> 10:33.550
So let's make the color white and let's add padding all around 20 pixels.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.050
Save that.

10:35.050 --> 10:35.940
Check it out.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.940
OK.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.040
Let's see are we.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.840
Why is inter padding.

10:44.850 --> 10:46.450
Oh you know what it is.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.440
We've since these three or have been floated.

10:50.550 --> 10:59.640
We need to actually clear that float so let's go up to our utility classes are we'll go under the last

10:59.790 --> 11:05.340
background here and do see a la and let's say float.

11:05.340 --> 11:14.430
I'm sorry not float clear both and then go back to our HD hymnal and right above the footer let's put

11:14.430 --> 11:17.840
in a class of C a la and save.

11:17.850 --> 11:24.750
And now you can see that it's pushed down and that's again that's another thing that just really sucks

11:24.750 --> 11:29.200
about using floats over seas says grid or flex boxes.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.500
Is this clearing stuff.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.720
That's why forget.

11:32.850 --> 11:33.170
All right.

11:33.180 --> 11:39.840
So our home page looks done and again it's not completely responsive I mean it's somewhat responsive

11:40.170 --> 11:44.630
as far as having the max width like the text doesn't go out of the page or anything like that.

11:44.640 --> 11:49.620
But there are some things I would add and I would add some media queries which we're going to talk about

11:49.620 --> 11:50.810
later on.

11:51.090 --> 11:55.030
But for now I think that our home page is pretty good.

11:55.080 --> 12:00.490
So in the next video we're going to move on to the about page which isn't too bad.

12:00.540 --> 12:05.370
We're just gonna have some text rounded image some testimonials.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.780
Then we'll move on to the contact page and we should be all set.

12:08.820 --> 12:12.500
And then I'll show you how we can actually deploy this Web site to the Internet.
