WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:00.590
OK.

00:00.630 --> 00:04.140
So we went over the basics of flex box weekly.

00:04.230 --> 00:11.220
We add display flex to a container and then all of its immediate children get turned into flex items

00:11.220 --> 00:15.120
and we can align them horizontally or in a column.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.130
However we want.

00:16.230 --> 00:21.490
And there's also alignment classes we can use so justification alignment and so on.

00:21.570 --> 00:28.950
So to display this we're going to create a new file called 1 7 underscore flex underscore a line dot

00:28.980 --> 00:39.270
HD him l put our boiler plate in and let's change the title to flex a line and we'll put in our style

00:39.270 --> 00:42.530
tags.

00:44.370 --> 00:50.820
And in the body I just I want the same thing I just want three divs but I want them to have a class

00:50.820 --> 00:53.520
of item and then also their own custom class.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.420
So item 1 2 and 3.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.090
So let's use em in here we'll do class item also.

00:59.230 --> 01:05.820
Class item Dash and I wanted to increment 1 to 3 so we'll use a money sign here and then for the content

01:05.820 --> 01:08.080
inside we use curly braces.

01:08.160 --> 01:13.320
We'll put an H 3 inside each age 3 inside each one and we'll just say item.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.510
And then an incremental number.

01:15.540 --> 01:19.190
So money sign and we'll do this three times four times three.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.980
And there we go.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.140
And one thing I forgot to do was add a container.

01:25.170 --> 01:32.160
So we want to grab all these and shift our option and hit the up arrow and you can just bring it right

01:32.160 --> 01:32.400
up.

01:32.950 --> 01:33.500
OK.

01:33.510 --> 01:45.620
So let's open this in live server and I just want to add some general styling too to the the items.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.920
So let's do that real quick.

01:47.950 --> 01:53.520
So I'm actually gonna paste it in the same styling we had the great background the border padding alignment

01:53.520 --> 02:03.530
and so on and then I'm also gonna add let's do a margin of let's say zero point five for him.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.260
OK.

02:05.270 --> 02:13.980
Now for in order for these to be flex items of course we need to add to the container we need to add

02:13.980 --> 02:15.940
display flex

02:19.080 --> 02:25.730
so we'll save that and again automatically it's going to align Horizontal into a row.

02:25.770 --> 02:30.710
Now let's say that we don't want to just use flex 1 Flex 2 We don't want it to go all the way across

02:30.720 --> 02:31.220
we want them.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.960
We want to give these custom widths.

02:33.960 --> 02:40.830
So basically what we can do is we could use with I'm just going to make them all the same but we could

02:40.830 --> 02:46.200
use width like this and say three hundred pixels.

02:46.360 --> 02:52.540
So now each one is 300 pixels but there is another property that we can use with Flex items called flex

02:52.540 --> 03:00.460
basis which will also give it a width of 300 pixels so basically does the same thing.

03:00.460 --> 03:00.870
All right.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.370
Now let's start off.

03:02.400 --> 03:11.560
Let's start looking at the alignment classes so I want to I want to align these on the are the horizontal

03:11.560 --> 03:13.190
axis right here.

03:13.210 --> 03:20.760
So for that we use justified content and these alignment classes they're going to go classes but properties

03:20.750 --> 03:22.570
are going to go on the container.

03:22.660 --> 03:31.420
So let's say justify dash content and there's a lot of different values for this.

03:31.420 --> 03:37.660
The default is going to be flex start which is is basically aligned to the right here.

03:37.660 --> 03:43.810
Let's actually make this 2D 200 pixels another two hundred pixels.

03:43.810 --> 03:47.420
So flecks start is basically aligning them all to the right.

03:47.440 --> 03:54.520
I'm sorry the left and then we have flex and if we want to align to the right you can see they all got

03:54.520 --> 03:59.840
pushed over another value we have is center.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.550
So we can align them all to the center.

04:01.990 --> 04:08.930
Now we have some some really cool values that we can use as well sort of close that up.

04:09.520 --> 04:16.750
So we have space around we do that what that's gonna do is it's going to divide the space around each

04:16.750 --> 04:22.380
one so you can see over here and then we have the space around the first one around the second one at

04:22.380 --> 04:30.490
and around the third one another one we have is space between which is similar except it's not on the

04:30.490 --> 04:39.700
edge the space the remaining space is going to go in between like that we also have space evenly and

04:39.700 --> 04:45.280
if we save that you'll see now it's just even on all sides so really really cool these these alignment

04:45.370 --> 04:50.410
on the properties and what I'm going to do is I'm going to paste in here inside of a comment all the

04:50.410 --> 04:56.500
different options just so you have them so you know in case you need to come back to this.

04:56.650 --> 05:03.730
All right now let's take a look at a line items which is actually going to align it this way.

05:03.760 --> 05:08.160
Now in order for this to work you're gonna have to set a height on your container.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.620
Now for the container I'm gonna give it a background color just so we can see it.

05:14.290 --> 05:21.070
So I'm gonna say background and let's do we'll do five five five and save.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.370
So right now it just wraps around the content.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.370
But let's give this container a height.

05:26.410 --> 05:26.920
Okay.

05:26.950 --> 05:34.200
So I'm gonna say height and we'll do six hundred pixels and save.

05:34.540 --> 05:34.920
OK.

05:34.940 --> 05:40.980
Now the default for this is gonna be stretch for a line item.

05:40.990 --> 05:50.410
So let's say a line items and if we say stretch and save you'll see that it's the same thing.

05:50.410 --> 05:54.360
Basically they're gonna just stretch all the way down.

05:54.370 --> 06:00.340
Now we also have flex start and flex and so if we do flex start you'll see that there's just going to

06:00.340 --> 06:01.880
line up here.

06:02.470 --> 06:07.490
If we do flex and they're gonna go to the bottom.

06:07.570 --> 06:08.320
If we do

06:11.380 --> 06:16.780
center they're gonna go right in the center as you can see how easy a line aligning this stuff is.

06:16.780 --> 06:23.490
We don't have to judge and do like a padding top in and have it be different pertaining to the browser

06:23.490 --> 06:23.830
high.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.450
Like it's always gonna be in the center.

06:26.620 --> 06:31.510
So let's look at some other ones we also have actually those.

06:31.510 --> 06:39.850
Yeah I think the only other one we have is base line which is just just the normal much of the difference

06:39.850 --> 06:48.460
between baseline and flex start actually but those are the values I'm going to pace those in and let's

06:48.460 --> 06:51.310
just put a comment here and say justify.

06:51.310 --> 06:55.420
Content is is when we align items

06:57.640 --> 07:09.010
horizontal and then a line items is to be a line items vertical OK.

07:09.090 --> 07:13.290
And we should as you put in here that there must be a height

07:17.020 --> 07:26.240
OK so next we're going to show you is a line content and this aligns vertical when there's extra space.

07:26.240 --> 07:33.730
So basically if they wrap what I'm going to do is just copy this down a bunch I'll get rid of it after

07:33.740 --> 07:36.240
but let's save that and let's make it wrap.

07:36.380 --> 07:45.460
So remember we have flex dash wrap and we'll set it to wrap.

07:45.800 --> 07:51.510
I actually think that's too much for the 600 pixel container for the height.

07:53.380 --> 07:53.650
Yeah.

07:53.670 --> 07:54.940
So we'll do that.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.850
So actually take off one more.

07:56.850 --> 08:00.150
So we just have two rows.

08:00.150 --> 08:06.040
So a line content is going to deal with how these are aligned vertically.

08:06.060 --> 08:17.330
So let's go right here and say a line dash content and let's set it to flex start.

08:18.320 --> 08:18.680
OK.

08:18.690 --> 08:24.250
So if we save that you'll see that now that we don't have that giant space in between.

08:24.260 --> 08:24.510
OK.

08:24.540 --> 08:30.030
If we want to do flex and save it's going to move all of them to the bottom.

08:30.030 --> 08:31.920
If we do center

08:34.640 --> 08:44.030
gonna go to the center if we do space around we'll do space around which I think is the default.

08:44.090 --> 08:51.860
But we also have space between save that and then that's going to they're just going to go with the

08:51.860 --> 08:52.220
top.

08:52.250 --> 08:56.490
So yeah this has to do with having more than one row.

08:56.630 --> 09:08.690
So I'm going to put a comment here and let's say a line items vertical where there's extra space and

09:08.690 --> 09:10.850
then I'm going to paste the options in here

09:13.870 --> 09:15.480
so hopefully this makes sense.

09:15.490 --> 09:22.270
Now we can also add alignments properties to individual items.

09:22.330 --> 09:25.780
So what I'm going to do is go back to having just three

09:28.450 --> 09:33.100
and let's say we want the second one to be down here.

09:33.100 --> 09:37.030
We want to keep the these two up here but have the middle one down.

09:37.030 --> 09:41.060
So what we can do is that has a class of item to

09:43.610 --> 09:44.150
to

09:46.790 --> 09:48.150
item two.

09:48.490 --> 09:54.820
And then let's put a comment let's say a line it's a single

09:57.580 --> 09:58.960
item vertical.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.550
So this is gonna be a line self.

10:02.910 --> 10:03.240
OK.

10:03.250 --> 10:08.380
So a line self and let's do flex and save it.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.000
Take a look.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.010
And now this one item two is now aligned flex and we can do center if we want

10:18.720 --> 10:19.860
and now it's in the center.

10:19.890 --> 10:26.700
So I'm just going to paste in the options for align self OK.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.510
So the last thing I want to show you is the order.

10:29.560 --> 10:35.320
We can change up the order here without having to change the markup which is is pretty powerful because

10:35.800 --> 10:41.020
your markup you want to be very semantic and you want it to be orderly but you might want it displayed

10:41.020 --> 10:42.220
differently in the browser.

10:42.250 --> 10:49.180
So instead of having to move things around here we can simply use the order property.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.780
So what I'm going to do is say let's to

10:55.370 --> 11:06.380
item one and we already have item two here and then let's do item three and for item three let's to

11:06.380 --> 11:19.620
order one item one we'll do order three in item two let's to order two.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.710
So basically it should be three to one.

11:21.710 --> 11:23.220
So let's save.

11:23.300 --> 11:29.620
And now if we check it out we have item 3 first two and then one and we didn't do anything in the markup.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.270
We just did it all within CSX.

11:32.270 --> 11:34.160
So that's flex order.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.570
I'm sorry just order.

11:36.710 --> 11:37.010
All right.

11:37.010 --> 11:43.790
So I think that we've covered pretty much the basics the core flex blocks and if you're still confused

11:43.850 --> 11:44.860
don't worry about it.

11:44.870 --> 11:49.910
Next we're going to jump in to a pretty cool project where we're gonna be using flex quite a bit.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.170
All right.

11:50.180 --> 11:51.650
So I'll see you in the project.
