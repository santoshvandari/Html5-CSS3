00:00.210 --> 00:05.010
Hey guys in this video we're gonna look at Tech's shadows and this is another thing that I personally

00:05.010 --> 00:06.950
don't use that much.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.450
Just like we can add shadows to elements.

00:09.450 --> 00:11.180
We can also add them to text.

00:11.190 --> 00:20.540
So let's create a new file in our sandbox called 0 5 underscore text underscore shadows dot age CML.

00:20.740 --> 00:24.470
OK we'll go ahead and put our boiler plate in and just going to close up the sidebar.

00:26.330 --> 00:26.950
Let's say.

00:26.950 --> 00:35.990
Text shadows put in our style and what I'm gonna do here is just I'm just gonna have four different

00:36.020 --> 00:36.980
H ones.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.290
OK so we're gonna say one and inside the content.

00:41.300 --> 00:45.560
Let's say Welcome to my course.

00:46.610 --> 00:47.120
OK.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.800
And I just want to add actually let's do this.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.990
Two times four.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.570
And I want to add a class a different class to each one.

00:59.570 --> 01:00.290
So let's say.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.400
Class a

01:05.600 --> 01:06.650
class B

01:09.750 --> 01:14.630
S Class C

01:16.940 --> 01:18.330
Class D.

01:18.350 --> 01:18.610
OK.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.940
So we have these different classes on each H1 because I want to give you a different example for each

01:22.940 --> 01:23.690
one.

01:23.690 --> 01:33.140
Now I'm going to do just a core styling here of font family and let's do aerial and then let's make

01:33.140 --> 01:34.690
the font size pretty big.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.430
So we'll do font size.

01:36.440 --> 01:45.060
Let's do five REM and we'll go ahead and open that up and actually do a little bit smaller for them.

01:45.140 --> 01:45.450
Good.

01:45.980 --> 01:52.460
So let's start off with the first one which is an H one with a class of A.

01:52.460 --> 01:57.650
And of course I could just do dot a but I just want to I'm changing things up just see you guys remember

01:57.650 --> 01:58.750
that you can do this.

01:58.760 --> 02:05.180
You don't know you can do just a or you can target the H one with the class of a.

02:05.250 --> 02:12.740
So let me just paste this in just like with box shadow we have a couple different values so we have

02:12.740 --> 02:18.650
the H shadow which is horizontal shadow in the vertical or V shadow and the color.

02:18.740 --> 02:24.900
So let's go ahead and add to this first one text dash shadow.

02:25.310 --> 02:34.880
And I want to use rhyme units I'm just going to do point to REM H shadow wants to point to REM v shadow

02:34.910 --> 02:38.660
and for color I'm going to use steel blue.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.750
So let's save that see what it looks like.

02:41.780 --> 02:50.090
So as you can see the the horizontal shadow basically is this way vertical shadow is going down it's

02:50.090 --> 02:50.810
going this way.

02:50.810 --> 02:54.510
So it kind of comes off diagonal this way.

02:54.830 --> 03:00.790
Now just like with the box shadow we can also have a blur.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.750
So let's do an H1 let's do each one B.

03:04.310 --> 03:08.570
So we're now targeting the B class which is the second one here.

03:08.930 --> 03:19.160
And spaces in here so it's actually blur and then color and going to copy what we already have appear

03:19.170 --> 03:20.980
and pieces in.

03:21.270 --> 03:30.940
So let's do let's do for RAM will do for RAM 3 ram for the V shadow and then for the blur.

03:30.950 --> 03:32.140
Let's do.

03:32.180 --> 03:32.590
We'll do.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.520
Point seven RAM and we'll keep steel blue.

03:37.550 --> 03:43.400
So let's save that and I can see that we have the the blur effect and you can use pixels if you want.

03:43.400 --> 03:48.010
It doesn't have to be ram units but that gives kind of a different look.

03:48.710 --> 03:52.790
So next thing I want to do is white text.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.700
So it's to H1 dots see

03:59.120 --> 04:02.090
let's do white text.

04:02.090 --> 04:08.360
So basically what we're doing is setting the color to white I save that it's going to just completely

04:08.360 --> 04:09.040
disappear.

04:09.050 --> 04:16.090
But what we can do is add the shadow so that we can actually make out the text.

04:16.100 --> 04:26.490
So we'll do two zero point two Ram zero point two Ram.

04:26.690 --> 04:34.940
Let's do one ram for the blur and let's do still below and save and it's going to look like that.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.460
So we get some pretty cool text effects here.

04:37.460 --> 04:42.090
Again not something that I would really use that much but it's good to know.

04:42.140 --> 04:50.020
So for the last one here I want to show you that we can use negative values.

04:50.820 --> 04:51.250
OK.

04:51.260 --> 04:54.170
So I'm just going to copy this.

04:54.650 --> 04:56.150
Let's grab this one here

04:59.290 --> 05:04.510
and instead of it coming this way I want it to go up.

05:04.590 --> 05:05.590
I want to go this way.

05:05.590 --> 05:12.480
So we could add a negative value for the H shadow and the v shadow and we'll save.

05:12.490 --> 05:19.260
And now I could see that the blur is is up here rather than down here OK.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.960
So that's about it guys.

05:21.020 --> 05:25.010
We probably won't use this this text shadow again.

05:25.010 --> 05:30.260
I just wanted to include it in the course in case you like it and you want to use it maybe in like a

05:30.260 --> 05:32.810
showcase area or something like that.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.110
All right.

05:33.110 --> 05:34.910
So I will see you in the next video.
