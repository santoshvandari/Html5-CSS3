WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:04.890
All right in this video we're going to talk about and look at meta tags which are tags or snippets that

00:04.890 --> 00:11.640
describe a page's content and they don't appear in the body of the web page anywhere nobody sees them.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.990
It just describes some stuff about the page.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.990
So we're going to look at some of the popular ones including the ones that are used in search engines.

00:20.040 --> 00:27.850
So let's create a new file we'll call it 0 3 underscore Metta underscore tags dot h t AML and I'm gonna

00:27.870 --> 00:29.640
generate my content with Emmet.

00:29.670 --> 00:35.990
So I'm going to use exclamation tab or enter and notice that it adds three meta tags.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.190
It also adds a laying attribute which you don't need in your age team I'll tag what it just describes

00:41.190 --> 00:42.890
the language is English.

00:43.140 --> 00:46.920
And these are all attributes so tags have attributes.

00:46.920 --> 00:53.730
We're gonna be using them along the way and they describe basically their properties of the tag.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.770
So all of these are meta right.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.770
So the only difference is the different attributes.

00:58.770 --> 01:01.630
That's all we can tell what what each one is.

01:02.370 --> 01:08.370
So the first one here is char set which is the character set and this specifies the character encoding

01:08.370 --> 01:09.260
of the page.

01:09.390 --> 01:12.240
So UTF 8 is actually the default.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.220
It's the character encoding for unicode.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.760
It's not extremely important to understand how this works or what it is.

01:18.780 --> 01:25.320
It's we could actually remove this and it would still be UTF 8 and the unicode standard covers almost

01:25.320 --> 01:30.150
all characters punctuation punctuation symbols things like that.

01:30.150 --> 01:35.400
So that's what that is is the character set that this page uses the next one here is pretty important

01:35.400 --> 01:36.990
for Responsive design.

01:36.990 --> 01:41.310
This is the viewport tag and responsive design it.

01:41.370 --> 01:49.000
It's all about making your your website or your user interface responsive to different screen sizes.

01:49.030 --> 01:56.460
OK so you want your Web site to look good on a desktop a laptop smartphone a tablet and there's different

01:56.460 --> 02:02.370
strategies mostly to do with CSX on making your site look good on these devices.

02:02.370 --> 02:08.530
But one of the things you want to do is add this viewport tag and you want to set the content value.

02:08.730 --> 02:13.830
You want to set a couple of things in the content which is 1 the width you want to set it to whatever

02:13.830 --> 02:18.690
the width of the device and the scale should be set to one point zero.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.850
So if you've ever gone on a nonresponsive site on a smartphone and you had to drag your finger over

02:23.850 --> 02:30.690
to kind of see the rest of the site that probably doesn't have the viewport set OK so you wanted to

02:30.690 --> 02:34.530
actually show the entire Web site or the entire interface.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.920
So that's what the viewport tag does it's actually really important.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.560
So this next one has to do with browser compatibility this HDP a quiver.

02:42.570 --> 02:49.950
You can see the content equals i.e. equals edge so i.e. is referring to the old Internet Explorer browser

02:49.950 --> 02:53.960
which is not used very much at all anymore.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.300
Windows now ships with Ed shore basically saying we want to use the edge standards and Microsoft browsers

03:00.300 --> 03:04.400
have been just a nightmare since since the beginning of web development.

03:04.470 --> 03:10.060
Back when I started it was Internet Explorer 6 which never rendered things correctly.

03:10.230 --> 03:14.580
You always had to do little hacks here and there and you're see assassin in your javascript to get things

03:14.580 --> 03:15.400
to work.

03:15.420 --> 03:22.410
So even now i.e. 11 which is the latest version is still very clunky but not too many people use it.

03:22.410 --> 03:28.110
I think if I look at my analytics on my Web site it's like zero point three percent or something ridiculous

03:28.110 --> 03:34.350
like that so it's not it's stream extremely important to support those browsers anymore unless you're

03:34.350 --> 03:40.590
building a Web site that may have like a lot of elderly people as viewers because a lot of them have

03:40.620 --> 03:44.810
older computers that they haven't updated that's still run i.e.

03:44.910 --> 03:45.270
All right.

03:45.300 --> 03:49.900
So now what I want to look at is met attacks that have to do with search engines.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.020
So we're gonna talk a little bit about search engines and the title is actually really important.

03:55.020 --> 03:58.360
I'm just gonna put meta tags here but you're in your title.

03:58.440 --> 04:03.500
You want to have you want to put something that really describes the page.

04:03.510 --> 04:08.020
You also want to put keywords that you want to rank for well on the search engines.

04:08.070 --> 04:15.450
Now MCO which is search engine optimization has changed dramatically from years ago likes the certain

04:15.450 --> 04:18.490
things that used to be really important are not anymore.

04:18.630 --> 04:24.300
And I'm not an NCO expert so I'm not going to speak too much on that but the title is what shows in

04:24.300 --> 04:25.170
the search engine.

04:25.170 --> 04:31.500
So if we jump into chrome here and let's open up a new tab and by the way this time that you see here

04:31.500 --> 04:36.330
in the background this is a chrome a Google Chrome extension called moment if you're interested.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.060
I know a lot of people ask me about it.

04:38.070 --> 04:42.420
So I figured I'd just tell you guys it has to dos and stuff like that it's pretty cool.

04:42.600 --> 04:53.610
But let's go ahead and go to Google dot com and let's search for like let's say Miami web design and

04:53.640 --> 04:57.590
we look at these Web sites that show up this large text here.

04:57.590 --> 04:58.780
This is the title.

04:58.860 --> 05:02.270
OK whatever you have in the title for the page is going to show up here.

05:02.360 --> 05:08.870
Most of the time if it doesn't match the pages content Google might take it upon itself to put something

05:08.870 --> 05:11.450
in here but usually it's going to be your title.

05:11.450 --> 05:16.520
And then this text here the smaller text is actually the description met a tag which I'll show you in

05:16.520 --> 05:17.160
a second.

05:17.270 --> 05:23.630
But if we go to this site and which I'm not affiliated at all with and if we could go ahead and view

05:23.630 --> 05:30.500
the source code with command option you or control you on a Windows machine and we look at the title

05:30.560 --> 05:35.720
you'll see it's Miami Web site design company digital agency and then the name of the company.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.880
So that's a good choice for a title.

05:37.910 --> 05:42.880
It has some keywords in there and also as the company name and you can see if I hover over the title.

05:42.890 --> 05:48.310
That's exactly it should should pop up here.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.960
Well usually does.

05:50.990 --> 05:54.890
I'm not sure why it's not popping up but usually it'll pop up and show you the whole title.

05:54.890 --> 05:55.760
There we go.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.760
And you can see that it matches what is in the HDL.

05:58.880 --> 06:10.390
And then if we look at the meta description tag which is see where is it's here's the viewport.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.240
Search for it.

06:11.250 --> 06:17.780
So if we do control F and search for a description here it is so meta.

06:17.790 --> 06:24.000
Name equals description in the content you'll see this is exactly what is showing up in the search engine.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.180
So fuse is a full service Miami website design company.

06:28.200 --> 06:34.060
If we go back to the the results here fuse is a full service Miami website design company.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.160
So this is going to be your description this is your title.

06:37.260 --> 06:40.830
So let's go ahead and add in a description.

06:41.250 --> 06:45.090
So we're gonna say meta and we want to use the name

06:47.940 --> 06:53.880
description and content you say whatever.

06:53.880 --> 07:01.800
I'm just gonna put this is my Web site description but you would want to put something that's that specifies

07:01.800 --> 07:03.390
what's on the page.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.150
You also want to put some keywords in here.

07:06.150 --> 07:11.400
I don't think the description holds too much weight but it is what what the user sees when they search

07:11.400 --> 07:13.640
for your site so that's pretty important.

07:13.740 --> 07:20.970
And another search engine related tag is the keywords met a tag.

07:20.970 --> 07:27.930
Now this keywords tag used to hold a lot of weight like years and years ago but now it's not it doesn't

07:27.930 --> 07:34.440
really matter it's just for describing the pages content so it's not like it's going to make or break

07:34.440 --> 07:39.920
your site in the search engine but generally you want to keep between like 8 and 12 words.

07:39.930 --> 07:47.040
So let's say this was a web web development company we'd put like web development maybe web design

07:49.920 --> 07:52.770
maybe ask your company name or something like that.

07:52.770 --> 07:57.650
So you generally want to have around 8 or so of these keywords.

07:57.720 --> 08:05.190
All right so let's see the last one that I want to show you is is if you don't want your site to rank

08:05.190 --> 08:10.530
in search engines if you don't want it to show up at all you would use the robot's meta tag.

08:10.650 --> 08:21.000
So let's say maiden name equals robots and for the content you would want to put no index so that it

08:21.000 --> 08:24.300
doesn't index your site in the search engine and then no follow.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.960
So it doesn't follow any links on the page and index those.

08:27.990 --> 08:28.290
All right.

08:28.290 --> 08:32.820
So for some reason you don't want your site to show up in Google and Bing and all the other engines

08:33.150 --> 08:42.120
you would just put this in here and I'll just put a comment do not index page.

08:42.540 --> 08:43.320
All right.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.440
So that's pretty much it.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.410
I'm going to go ahead and save that.

08:47.490 --> 08:51.590
I'm not going to go over any of the other ones right now because they're really not that important.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.980
If you want to look look look up some of the other ones on your own you can do that but I don't want

08:55.980 --> 08:59.600
to throw too much stuff at you that you don't really need right now.

08:59.790 --> 09:05.310
So that's it guys in the next video we're going to start to look at topography look at creating headings

09:05.310 --> 09:08.600
in paragraphs and bolded text and stuff like that.
