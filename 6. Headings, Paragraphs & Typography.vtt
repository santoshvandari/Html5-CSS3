WEBVTT

00:00.380 --> 00:00.840
All right guys.

00:00.840 --> 00:04.740
Now we're going to look at some tags that have to do with topography some of the stuff we already looked

00:04.740 --> 00:05.390
at like.

00:05.390 --> 00:07.950
Like the h1 tag which is a heading tag.

00:07.950 --> 00:13.830
We'll look at some of the other headings hand also paragraph and the strong tag and stuff like that.

00:13.830 --> 00:21.150
So let's create a new file here called 0 4 underscore topography dot aged him.

00:21.390 --> 00:26.920
I'm going to show you some other stuff as well some little tips and tricks when it comes to V.S. code.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.310
So let's put in our boilerplate which is we'll do exclamation tab and that puts in all of our R structure

00:35.310 --> 00:36.060
here.

00:36.060 --> 00:46.120
And for the title it's changed this will just say like headings paragraphs topography.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.090
OK.

00:49.110 --> 00:53.220
And then we're gonna go down to the body here and I'm going to put a comment.

00:53.220 --> 01:00.510
Now if you want to just put a comment like an empty comment you can just do control and then the question

01:00.510 --> 01:07.470
mark or the forward slash key and that will put an empty comment it might be camp command and that key

01:07.470 --> 01:08.250
on a Mac.

01:08.250 --> 01:12.650
I'm not sure because on my Mac I actually switch the control and the command keys.

01:12.780 --> 01:16.550
So when I say control it might it might be command on a Mac.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.120
I'm not sure.

01:18.120 --> 01:24.470
So let's go ahead and just put it in headings here and another tab if you want to go to the next line

01:24.480 --> 01:27.340
obviously you can go to the end here and you can hit enter.

01:27.510 --> 01:31.380
But if you're in the middle here and you hit enter it'll do that.

01:31.380 --> 01:37.530
If you want to have a clear new line and you're in the middle you can hold down control or again might

01:37.530 --> 01:42.830
be command and then enter and it'll create a new line no matter where you are here.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.880
It'll create a new line if you hold down control.

01:45.900 --> 01:46.170
OK.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.700
So keep that in mind and I'm gonna give you these little tips throughout the course because I think

01:50.700 --> 01:57.270
that it really helps you write your code in a more efficient way and in a much faster way.

01:57.270 --> 01:57.570
All right.

01:57.570 --> 02:01.080
So let's let's put some headings in here so H1.

02:01.080 --> 02:10.080
I'm just gonna say heading one and hold control and enter to go to the next line to h to tab heading

02:10.320 --> 02:13.800
to s h three

02:20.100 --> 02:27.420
heading for what else we had heading 5 it goes up to 6.

02:28.150 --> 02:31.690
So each six headings six.

02:31.690 --> 02:31.960
All right.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.900
So let's save this and let's open this up with the live server I might have to close some of your other

02:37.900 --> 02:40.750
tabs and this is what it's going to look like.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.670
So this is H1.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.930
It's going to be the largest.

02:43.930 --> 02:49.480
And then it goes smaller and smaller and then h six is going to be the smallest.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.960
Now you can change the font size or CSX.

02:51.970 --> 02:57.720
You can do whatever you want through CSX but by default each one is going to be the largest.

02:57.760 --> 03:04.330
Now a little tip or some advice that I would give is is you usually only want to have an H 1 H one per

03:04.330 --> 03:12.910
page because the search engines actually look at this and you want to have like you want to describe

03:12.910 --> 03:18.310
whatever the content is for instance if it's a blog post you want to have your your blog post title

03:19.150 --> 03:20.310
in the H1.

03:20.380 --> 03:21.250
OK.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.210
And you can have more.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.940
I mean you can have multiple H ones but it's good practice to just have one per page.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.990
And then these other ones you can have as many as as you want.

03:30.130 --> 03:32.200
Say you have a role of blog posts.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.060
Maybe you have an h three for each title.

03:35.080 --> 03:35.440
OK.

03:35.440 --> 03:42.000
So I mean it's not you know mandatory but I would suggest using one H1 per page if possible.

03:42.070 --> 03:43.090
So those are headings.

03:43.090 --> 03:47.370
Let's go ahead and look at paragraphs.

03:47.410 --> 03:50.510
We've already done this but it's just a p tag.

03:50.710 --> 03:54.000
Now I'm going to give you another tip here with Emmett.

03:54.010 --> 03:59.380
We can generate some dummy text if you need just some tax to kind of fill.

03:59.380 --> 04:06.700
You know as a place holder you can do Lorem L O R E M and then hit tab and it'll give you a paragraph

04:06.700 --> 04:13.780
of dummy text or filler text and if you want to specify a certain number of words like let's say we

04:13.780 --> 04:20.220
want a 10 word sentence or paragraph we could do Lorem 10 tab and it'll give us 10 words.

04:20.260 --> 04:20.490
OK.

04:20.530 --> 04:29.950
We could even do like Lorem 500 and we'll give us 500 words I'm gonna do let's say one hundred and just

04:29.950 --> 04:35.590
generate some tax and if I save this and we go and we take a look you'll see that we have this paragraph

04:35.590 --> 04:43.090
of 100 words now inside the paragraph I'm gonna add we'll just go anywhere it doesn't really matter

04:43.380 --> 04:46.020
and I'm gonna put in a strong tag.

04:46.180 --> 04:46.740
Okay.

04:46.930 --> 04:52.090
Now with this code once they put the beginning tag in it adds the ending one automatically so I'm just

04:52.090 --> 04:59.080
going to just cut that out and put that over here and then anything that's within here is within the

04:59.080 --> 04:59.990
strong tag.

04:59.990 --> 05:03.850
So let's save this and go back and notice that it's bolded.

05:03.850 --> 05:04.170
OK.

05:04.180 --> 05:11.500
So by default it will be bold but with CSX you could change the styling of this strong tag to be a different

05:11.500 --> 05:15.980
color or to be bigger a bigger font whatever you want to do with it.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.210
But it's it's made to make it stand out.

05:19.300 --> 05:27.580
And at the same time you have the emphasis tag which is the E M So let's say E and I'm going to just

05:27.580 --> 05:34.190
put the ending tag let's say down here and if we save that we take a look by default it's going to be

05:34.190 --> 05:34.930
a italic.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.940
It's actually this right here.

05:37.060 --> 05:37.370
OK.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.950
You can see that the text is italic which again you can change within CSX.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.010
And we're going to get into CSX in the next section.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.770
So that's strong and emphasis.

05:47.770 --> 05:51.960
We also have the line break which I showed you in one of the slides.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.470
It's one of these self closing tags so let's say we want a space right here without adding a new paragraph.

06:00.610 --> 06:05.580
If I just do this and save it's not going to reflect that in the browser.

06:05.620 --> 06:05.890
OK.

06:05.890 --> 06:12.310
This is only in the ED I can put a million spaces here and save and it doesn't show in the browser to

06:12.310 --> 06:18.880
actually have a line break without adding a new paragraph you would add in a bizarre tag.

06:18.880 --> 06:24.750
So I'm going to go right here and put in a b r tag.

06:25.370 --> 06:30.260
So what that's going to do is it's going to knock this on to the next line in the browser as you can

06:30.260 --> 06:31.450
see right here.

06:31.640 --> 06:43.570
If I wanted it to go down again I could add in another bar tag I'm just going to put a comment here.

06:44.850 --> 06:45.170
OK.

06:45.170 --> 06:51.020
So if we have two line breaks you'll see that it pushes it down again and I can push it down as much

06:51.020 --> 06:51.980
as I want.

06:52.160 --> 06:57.110
And since it's a self closing tag you could either do this format or you could do that.

06:57.110 --> 07:07.070
So both of these are going to work as you can see I tend to use this just the HDMI five but sometimes

07:07.070 --> 07:13.370
I use a visual studio code extension called prettier which will auto format your code and it adds a

07:13.370 --> 07:14.910
slash automatically.

07:14.960 --> 07:20.570
So if you watch some of my other videos and I have the slash that's because I'm using prettier and I

07:20.570 --> 07:23.690
might introduce that extension to you guys later.

07:23.690 --> 07:28.340
Now in addition to the bar tab we have an H.R. tag which is a horizontal rule.

07:28.340 --> 07:39.340
I'm actually going to put that see we'll go right here and it's a horizontal rule and what this does.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.250
The H.R. tag is it.

07:41.270 --> 07:44.470
It does a line break but it also creates an actual line.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.750
So if we check this so you can see it put a line across the screen.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.300
OK so that's a horizontal rule.

07:51.320 --> 07:57.320
Now if you've studied each tool before especially if it was a while ago before age 2 0 5 you might have

07:57.320 --> 07:59.990
seen tags like the bold tag.

08:00.110 --> 08:05.960
So if we put a B here you might have scenes to stuff like this.

08:05.960 --> 08:14.030
So if we actually take a look at this in Chrome you'll see that it actually is bold but there's the

08:14.030 --> 08:20.000
bold tag along with the eye tag for italics and stuff like that that you tag for underline it's all

08:20.000 --> 08:28.680
been deprecated because h Tim L. is not meant for styling and this strong tag replace the bull tag because

08:28.680 --> 08:34.160
the strong tag is a semantic tag it doesn't necessarily mean it's bold it just means that it should

08:34.160 --> 08:40.700
stand out in some way but we leave it up to the C to to say what that way is even though it builds by

08:40.700 --> 08:44.450
default and that's kind of hard to understand.

08:44.510 --> 08:49.520
It did confuse me in the beginning when each team of five came out but just know that we don't really

08:49.580 --> 08:56.030
use this anymore or the you or I think there was asked for strike through although we do have a semantic

08:56.030 --> 09:05.280
tag for deleted text which does by default at a strike through so let's say we do DL and we're going

09:05.280 --> 09:08.450
to wrap this text right here.

09:08.630 --> 09:14.420
So this is actually a semantic tag so we'll save this and take a look and notice that it does add a

09:14.420 --> 09:20.360
strike through ok but it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be strike through we can change that

09:20.360 --> 09:26.120
in the CSX if we want maybe we want it to be highlighted with a yellow background or something like

09:26.120 --> 09:32.510
that it doesn't necessarily mean strike through like the s tag did they took that out of each team L5

09:32.830 --> 09:34.210
or deprecated it.

09:34.220 --> 09:34.490
All right.

09:34.490 --> 09:39.530
So in the next video we're going to take a look at links hyperlinks and we're going to also look at

09:39.530 --> 09:41.900
embedding images into a web page.
