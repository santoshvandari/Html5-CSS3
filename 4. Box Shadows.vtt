WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:01.020
All right guys.

00:01.020 --> 00:07.260
Now we're going to look at the box shadow property and box Sharyl actually takes a bunch of different

00:07.260 --> 00:11.960
values so we're gonna go over those and we're going to just show you how to add some shadows to some

00:11.970 --> 00:12.860
as some did.

00:12.870 --> 00:14.050
Some elements here.

00:14.130 --> 00:21.120
So let's create a new file called 0 4 underscore box underscore shadows dot HD here.

00:21.120 --> 00:29.550
Now let's add our boilerplate say a box shadows

00:31.800 --> 00:34.520
style.

00:34.650 --> 00:39.210
Now for the H table I'm just gonna put in a container class

00:41.700 --> 00:52.170
and let's do let's do three boxes so we'll do dot box and then in here will it's to put an H three.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.140
I'll just say heading and then a paragraph.

00:55.140 --> 00:58.550
I'll do Lorem 10 and then I'm just gonna have three of these.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.740
So we'll just go ahead and bring this down three times.

01:01.740 --> 01:06.990
All right let's open this with live server and should look like this.

01:06.990 --> 01:13.370
So what I want to do is I'm going to use flex to display the boxes.

01:13.380 --> 01:21.350
So we're gonna take the container class and we're just going to say display flex.

01:21.420 --> 01:21.820
Okay.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.790
So we have our boxes and then I'm just gonna add some base styling to the box class as well.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.200
Before we get into the shadows.

01:30.270 --> 01:31.590
So just some padding

01:34.850 --> 01:36.420
and let's do some margin

01:39.570 --> 01:41.040
and let's see we'll do.

01:41.070 --> 01:48.730
Let's do a background of coral and we'll see color white.

01:48.990 --> 01:49.260
All right.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.650
So now we have some boxes.

01:50.660 --> 02:02.040
I should probably make it a little wider so close this up and we should be good like great here okay.

02:02.040 --> 02:12.000
So we have boxes now we're gonna add some shadows so I'm going to say box shadow now like I said there's

02:12.000 --> 02:18.050
there's different basically options or values that you can that you can use.

02:18.040 --> 02:24.870
So I'm going to paste in a comment right above and we're going to put in three values here to to start

02:24.870 --> 02:25.350
off with.

02:25.350 --> 02:31.330
So the first is going to be the offset x next will be the offset Y and the last will be the color.

02:31.410 --> 02:35.240
So you guys know what a shadow is it just comes off the box.

02:35.250 --> 02:39.010
Now offset X is going to be on the x axis.

02:39.020 --> 02:47.400
K X is always gonna be horizontal Y is vertical so let's say for the x axis or am sorry X offset we

02:47.390 --> 02:52.760
want to do 10 pixels and then for the Y we'll do 10 pixels as well.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.300
And then next will be the color.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.000
I'm going to use teal.

02:56.180 --> 02:59.250
It's kind of kind of weird colors but I just wanted to stand out.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.920
So let's go ahead and save that.

03:02.190 --> 03:10.250
And as you can see it added a box shadow it put 10 pixels on the x axis ten on the Y.

03:10.410 --> 03:10.780
All right.

03:10.830 --> 03:20.970
Now I'm gonna be adding different box shadow values the next one I want to add the Blur radius because

03:20.970 --> 03:26.390
there's actually more that you can add and one of them is a blur radius.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.130
So this is gonna have four parameters so I'm going to copy what I did here and this is just going to

03:32.130 --> 03:34.340
overwrite the one before it.

03:34.650 --> 03:41.880
So the blow radius is going to be after the offset y and before the color and the blow radius is just

03:41.880 --> 03:48.060
that it's going to add a blur effect to it and it's in pixels so let's say 20 pixels and we'll save.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.610
And now notice that the shadows have a blur.

03:51.300 --> 03:57.660
And if these stick out too much for you if you want them to be less you could do like five pixels and

03:57.690 --> 04:00.600
save and now it's less and you can experiment with it.

04:00.720 --> 04:05.280
Now you can also do negative values for the offsets.

04:05.280 --> 04:12.420
What that will do is it will add the shadow to the top and the left by default we have the shadow coming

04:12.420 --> 04:14.640
out of the right and the bottom.

04:14.700 --> 04:21.990
But what we could do is just copy copy this line here and let's just say negative five and negative

04:21.990 --> 04:23.940
5 and save.

04:23.940 --> 04:28.250
And now you can see that the shadow was actually on the left and the top.

04:28.260 --> 04:35.520
OK so negative five on the X is going to go this way negative five on the Y is going to go up.

04:35.520 --> 04:35.820
All right.

04:35.850 --> 04:42.810
Now we can also do a spread radius so how far do we want it to spread.

04:42.810 --> 04:50.970
So I'm going to actually copy these comments again and I'm just putting these comments here so you know

04:50.970 --> 04:54.290
what each of these values are.

04:54.540 --> 04:58.740
So let's grab this one here.

04:58.740 --> 05:05.810
So we'll say let's do three pixels for the offset.

05:05.820 --> 05:08.720
Why offset X blur radius.

05:08.720 --> 05:16.560
Let's do 10 pixels and then see for the spread radius.

05:16.550 --> 05:22.170
We'll do one pixel and then instead of using a solid color I'm going to use our GPA.

05:22.170 --> 05:24.120
So it's red green blue alpha.

05:24.690 --> 05:27.810
So the red green blue we've went over this.

05:27.810 --> 05:30.180
I'm going to use zero for them all which will make it black.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.970
And then the Alpha is a transparency.

05:32.970 --> 05:37.800
So we're going to do zero point three here and save.

05:37.800 --> 05:43.710
So this is something I don't really use box shadows that much I don't particularly like the look of

05:43.710 --> 05:44.810
them.

05:44.820 --> 05:49.710
Some people do if I were to use them it would be something like this something very very subtle.

05:50.160 --> 05:59.070
So as in I would probably use our GPA because the the the less transparent the lighter this is if we

05:59.070 --> 06:03.290
were to do like zero point nine and save.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.950
You can see it's much darker.

06:04.950 --> 06:11.490
Now you may like that kind of look but I don't I think it looks really you know 2002 ish.

06:11.490 --> 06:18.970
So I don't use shadows that much but nevertheless you should know how to how to add them.

06:19.140 --> 06:19.880
All right.

06:20.040 --> 06:27.180
Let's see we can also do an inset box shadow meaning that it's not coming it's on on the outside it's

06:27.180 --> 06:28.410
on the inside.

06:28.410 --> 06:39.690
So I'm going to just paste this in here and let's say box shadow and we can specify inset and then we

06:39.690 --> 06:42.020
do the offset x x and y.

06:42.030 --> 06:48.170
So I'm actually going to do negative three pixels and negative three.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.340
So that's at the left and the top.

06:50.610 --> 06:59.410
And let's do teal and save I'm sorry not the left in the top it's going to be down here because when

06:59.410 --> 07:01.640
you do inset it's the opposite.

07:01.670 --> 07:08.090
If I wanted it to be the left in the top I would do positive values shows you how much I actually who's

07:08.090 --> 07:08.990
this.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.220
But yeah we can do that if we want.

07:11.250 --> 07:16.470
It's now it's on the inset of the box it's not coming like from the outside.

07:16.780 --> 07:19.030
And then we can also do multiple shadows

07:23.240 --> 07:30.860
so to do that we could say like Box shadow and we could do let's say three pixels three pixels teal

07:31.400 --> 07:39.080
and then we can put a comma and let's do negative three pixels negative three pixels and we'll do all

07:39.080 --> 07:40.550
of it's gonna be very ugly.

07:40.550 --> 07:47.420
But just to show you how this works if I save you can see now I have the teal shadow box shadow right

07:47.420 --> 07:49.490
here and then the all of.

07:49.490 --> 07:50.230
Up top.

07:50.480 --> 07:50.680
OK.

07:50.780 --> 07:55.730
So you can separate them with a comma if you want to add more and of course you could add a blur radius

07:55.760 --> 08:05.320
if we do let's do 10 pixels here and 10 pixels here and we'll save and we get our blurry radius.

08:06.080 --> 08:06.320
OK.

08:06.350 --> 08:11.300
So that's going to be it for box shadows guys like I said it's not something that I usually use I don't

08:11.360 --> 08:16.700
I don't really like the look of them but that's how how you use them in the next video we're going to

08:16.700 --> 08:18.530
take a look at text shadows.
