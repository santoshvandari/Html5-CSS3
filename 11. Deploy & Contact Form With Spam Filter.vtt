00:00.260 --> 00:02.510
All right guys so our project is now finished.

00:02.510 --> 00:04.980
So I want to go ahead and deploy it.

00:04.980 --> 00:10.430
I also want to give functionality to the contact form using net le fi forms.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.910
So I'm in my net lo fi panel so you just have to sign up if you don't have an account and then log in

00:15.910 --> 00:17.820
and you can do all this for free.

00:18.120 --> 00:24.730
And then this is the forms documentation because we want the contact form to actually work.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.730
So there's a few things we need to do.

00:26.730 --> 00:33.390
First we need to add a method of post and then this data net lo fi true to our form tag.

00:33.390 --> 00:42.450
So I'm just going to grab that and go into our contact page contact HD AML and right here I have the

00:42.450 --> 00:43.830
form tag we want.

00:43.830 --> 00:47.460
Method equals post and data and alpha equals true.

00:47.460 --> 00:50.430
Now we also want name attributes for each input.

00:50.430 --> 00:51.170
So let's say.

00:51.170 --> 00:52.320
Name.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.180
This is the name field.

00:54.330 --> 00:58.920
Let's do name equals subject

01:01.760 --> 01:04.340
to name equals email

01:08.350 --> 01:10.300
name equals.

01:10.300 --> 01:17.510
What is this phone and then name equals message.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.220
OK.

01:18.250 --> 01:21.800
Now we also want to add some spam filtering with recaptured.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.930
So I'm going to go back to the forms documentation and go down

01:28.670 --> 01:34.610
see we're going to go down to spam filtering honeypot field.

01:34.610 --> 01:35.570
No we don't want that.

01:35.570 --> 01:39.410
We want this explicit recapture.

01:39.740 --> 01:45.380
So basically you guys have seen this before and it says I'm not a robot you have to check it and sometimes

01:45.380 --> 01:47.630
you have to do those pictures.

01:47.630 --> 01:52.020
So we want that just to stop spam from from coming in.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.390
So what we have to do is add this attribute data net low fi recapture equals true.

01:58.440 --> 02:03.740
We want to add that to our form tag which is right here.

02:03.780 --> 02:11.240
So I'm going to paste that in and then wherever we want to put it I'm going to go under the text area

02:11.630 --> 02:18.230
and I'm going to put a div with the class of m y dash to just to give it some margin around it and then

02:18.230 --> 02:24.030
we want to grab this this div right here with data.

02:24.180 --> 02:27.550
Net lo fi recaptured true.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.110
They're going to put that right in there and save.

02:30.110 --> 02:35.510
Now this won't show until we deployed in that lo fi because the platform looks at these attributes and

02:35.510 --> 02:38.040
then puts in the recapture.

02:38.410 --> 02:38.710
OK.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.660
And I believe that's all we have to do here.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.020
Ajax form submissions yes.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.010
So we should be ok now.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.870
We have to upload this to get hub or if the push to get hubs.

02:54.880 --> 03:03.730
So I'm going to go to get hub dot com and I'm going to create a new repository

03:06.730 --> 03:15.630
I'm just going to call this portfolio underscore Web site I'm actually going to make this private but

03:15.630 --> 03:17.020
you can do public if you want.

03:17.070 --> 03:17.790
I'll just say

03:20.230 --> 03:27.940
portfolio Web site and let's go and create repository.

03:27.940 --> 03:34.260
OK so now I have an empty repository so I want to go back in to our project and I'm going to just use

03:34.260 --> 03:36.920
the integrated terminal down here.

03:37.770 --> 03:43.570
But before I do anything with get I'm going to add in a file in my route here.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.190
New file I'm going to call it dot get ignore.

03:47.550 --> 03:47.900
OK.

03:47.910 --> 03:53.070
And what this does is it allows you to specify files and folders that you don't want to push to get

03:53.070 --> 03:53.710
hub.

03:53.720 --> 03:59.640
Now we installed node SAS which is located in this node modules folder.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.950
You don't want to push this node modules folder.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.770
This is just dependencies of your project.

04:04.980 --> 04:12.660
If someone wants to use your project they'll pull it from GitHub and they'll run npm install which will

04:12.660 --> 04:18.750
look at any packages you have such as node SAS and it will then create the node modules folder with

04:19.080 --> 04:20.410
those dependencies.

04:20.490 --> 04:23.150
So we don't want to push the node modules folder.

04:23.160 --> 04:28.280
So we're just going to put in here node underscore modules and save.

04:28.290 --> 04:37.110
And I do want to push the dist I want the the SAS and that's that should be it.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.980
So we just want the node modules not to be committed.

04:40.980 --> 04:47.550
So now let's initialize a get repository with get in it and make sure you have get installed.

04:47.550 --> 04:55.160
If you don't go to get dash SVM dot com and install it so you initialized our gate repository.

04:55.170 --> 05:00.180
Now it's to get add all okay.

05:00.190 --> 05:02.590
So now it's added to our local repository.

05:02.590 --> 05:03.790
Let's commit it.

05:03.790 --> 05:09.780
So get commit and we want to do dash M and then a comment.

05:09.790 --> 05:15.020
I'm just going to say initial commit.

05:15.020 --> 05:15.330
OK.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.950
So it added it committed it to our local repository.

05:17.950 --> 05:24.550
Now we want to add our github repository as the remote repository that we want to use which is this

05:24.550 --> 05:25.510
line right here.

05:25.540 --> 05:30.430
So you want to grab that and paste that in and right.

05:30.940 --> 05:31.690
OK.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.570
So now that's added as our remote repository.

05:34.660 --> 05:41.140
And then the last thing we want to do is this last line which is get push dash you origin master.

05:41.140 --> 05:51.400
So we want to push to the master branch so we'll clear this up and I'll say get push dash you origin

05:51.850 --> 05:57.720
master.

05:57.830 --> 06:02.480
So it's just pushing it to the remote repository.

06:02.480 --> 06:08.360
Now if I go back and I reload this page you'll see that our project is now uploaded to get I probably

06:08.360 --> 06:14.570
should have put this D.S. store file and get ignored as well but that's fine.

06:14.570 --> 06:14.930
All right.

06:14.930 --> 06:18.560
So the project we want to deploy is in the disk.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.690
This is what we want.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.020
On net lo fi.

06:21.020 --> 06:21.410
OK.

06:21.410 --> 06:26.930
So when we deploy the Natalya fi we want to specify this is our build folder.

06:26.930 --> 06:37.300
So now let's head over to nullify and going to say new site from get GitHub and I'm going to search

06:37.300 --> 06:39.190
for portfolio

06:44.720 --> 06:49.000
C portfolio Web site and the branch.

06:49.010 --> 06:52.040
I want to deploy I only have one branch which is M..

06:52.040 --> 06:58.340
Now the published directory is going to be dist and it even says right here some examples are dist public

06:58.340 --> 06:58.760
site.

06:58.760 --> 07:04.640
So we want to do dist because that has the H team L and our comp. CSX.

07:04.640 --> 07:10.740
Okay so let's go ahead and say deploy site site deploy in progress

07:17.660 --> 07:19.100
should just take a second.

07:19.130 --> 07:19.970
There we go.

07:19.970 --> 07:25.700
So now we have our domain here so I'm going to go ahead and open this up and there we go and you can

07:25.700 --> 07:31.400
see we have a subdomain of net lo fi but we could easily set up a custom domain.

07:31.400 --> 07:37.190
I'm not going to do that in this video though but let's make sure that first of all all of our pages

07:37.190 --> 07:40.730
show which they do that loads kind of slow

07:44.660 --> 07:46.070
that's slow and you know why.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.700
Because the images are so big.

07:47.710 --> 07:56.890
So the first load is a little slow so if you're going to actually use this as a production project you

07:56.890 --> 08:01.420
probably want to resize these images because these are really really big images.

08:01.570 --> 08:06.040
And I didn't I didn't optimize them at all.

08:06.220 --> 08:10.000
So contact you can see we have a little recapture here.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.230
Let's go ahead and try this out.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.020
So I'll say Kevin Smith email address.

08:14.020 --> 08:17.710
Kevin subject will just say hello.

08:17.710 --> 08:18.900
Phone number.

08:20.590 --> 08:21.220
Hello.

08:21.220 --> 08:24.330
This is a test.

08:24.490 --> 08:28.130
I'm not a robot and submit.

08:28.180 --> 08:28.870
Thank you.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.620
Go back to our site OK.

08:32.740 --> 08:39.700
Now if we go back to our net lo fi panel and let's reload this page

08:42.400 --> 08:43.610
and go down here.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.900
There's our form submission Kevin Smith name subject.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.440
Hello.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.180
Email phone and message.

08:51.190 --> 08:51.450
OK.

08:51.480 --> 08:57.910
So we have a fully working site that we built with SAS that we deployed with working contact form that

08:57.910 --> 09:00.270
has spam filtering.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.880
And of course you can add any fields you want.

09:03.010 --> 09:09.490
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this project and learned a lot from it and you hopefully you'll use it

09:09.790 --> 09:11.420
in your career and in your life.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.890
So thank you so much for watching guys I really appreciate it.

09:14.890 --> 09:22.810
And I will see you in the wrap up video that we deployed with working contact form that has spam filtering

09:22.840 --> 09:29.200
and of course you can add any fields you want so hopefully you guys enjoyed this project and learned

09:29.200 --> 09:34.000
a lot from it and you hopefully you'll use it in your career and in your life.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.360
So thank you so much for watching guys I really appreciate it.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.450
And I will see you in the wrap up video.
