00:00.380 --> 00:04.350
All right guys so now we're going to take a look at media queries with the grid.

00:04.350 --> 00:12.870
So let's create a file called 0 6 underscore grid underscore media queries dot each team Al

00:18.520 --> 00:25.160
and put our style tags so I'm going to create the the the markup first.

00:25.160 --> 00:33.290
So we're gonna have a container of grid and then let's do an item and an H three inside here or just

00:33.290 --> 00:39.050
say heading and then a paragraph with the text we'll just do last 15.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.010
And then I'm going to copy this down.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.560
I want four of them so going to do three more.

00:44.570 --> 00:44.900
All right.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.970
And we'll go ahead and save this and open it with live server.

00:48.970 --> 00:49.300
OK.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.760
So let's start off with adding a grid.

00:52.790 --> 01:05.870
So we'll take the parent element and we'll set it to display grid and let's say grid dash template columns

01:05.930 --> 01:14.280
and we're going to do a repeat say repeat for auto.

01:14.280 --> 01:14.680
OK.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.390
So that's going to set them to basically a four column grid.

01:19.550 --> 01:24.480
And we'll do a grid gap one room.

01:24.500 --> 01:24.830
All right.

01:24.860 --> 01:31.140
Now the way that that this is naturally is it's just going it's it's four columns no matter what.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.220
Okay no matter how small.

01:33.440 --> 01:42.150
And what I would like to do is have it so that when we get to a certain point like maybe tablet size

01:42.170 --> 01:50.420
768 or so we change it to two columns and then when we get to Mobile it's stacked meaning that it's

01:50.420 --> 01:51.840
just one column.

01:51.860 --> 01:56.210
So this is pretty easy to do we can just add in media query

01:59.280 --> 02:07.130
so let's say we want this to be four Max with 768 pixels.

02:07.140 --> 02:13.140
We need that and then we're going to simply take our grid element and we're going to say we want grid

02:13.170 --> 02:17.820
actual just copy this here and let's say for Max with

02:20.490 --> 02:22.520
768 we want to.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.720
So we'll say repeat to auto now.

02:24.930 --> 02:29.940
Once they hit 768 you can see that it goes to two.

02:30.150 --> 02:30.440
All right.

02:30.450 --> 02:36.270
And then we'll just add another one so I'll copy this and we'll say at 500.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.280
So basically smartphones.

02:38.430 --> 02:45.040
I simply want one FDR actually noting and do instead of auto I'm just gonna do one FDR like that.

02:45.060 --> 02:52.170
So we get the same result on big screens and then basically tablet size and then we get to smartphone

02:52.170 --> 02:53.940
size stacks.

02:54.120 --> 02:58.910
So it's as easy as that to use media queries with the grid.

02:59.040 --> 03:05.520
Now we also have grid template areas which we went over in the last video so I want to show you what

03:05.520 --> 03:07.000
we would do in that case.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.850
So I'm actually going to open up the file from the last video and just add to that.

03:11.850 --> 03:16.710
So let's go ahead and open this with live server.

03:16.710 --> 03:22.660
So right now even if we go down you know to mobile size that doesn't look very good.

03:22.710 --> 03:32.880
So all we would have to do is add a media query so we'll say at media and I'm just going to do.

03:33.010 --> 03:36.260
Let's see let's see what this looks like it like 768.

03:36.270 --> 03:39.390
So it's OK that that's fine for like a tablet size.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.930
But for smartphones we want to change it.

03:41.940 --> 03:48.060
So let's do a max width of let's say five hundred pixels.

03:48.060 --> 03:54.090
And what we would do is just change up the grid template areas so we'll take this and if we want to

03:54.090 --> 03:58.700
stack everything we can simply have one column.

03:58.710 --> 04:07.010
So we'll do header content which I forgot to put the D.

04:07.130 --> 04:14.310
Select the selector which is going to be our container of grid or is it.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.870
Wait no it's contain or sorry.

04:16.940 --> 04:21.760
So container and then I'm going to piece that in and we'll say header.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.120
So I only want one.

04:23.120 --> 04:35.830
We want these to be stack so header content and then we'll add in here side bar we'll do box 1 box 2

04:36.640 --> 04:39.210
box 3 and footer.

04:39.490 --> 04:39.770
OK.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.680
So it's only one column.

04:41.680 --> 04:47.280
And again this is this is visually representative of what we actually want to display in our browser

04:47.290 --> 04:48.100
so let's save.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.740
And now everything is nicely stacked.

04:50.740 --> 04:50.990
OK.

04:51.010 --> 04:55.050
So when it hits 500 pixels everything stacks nicely.

04:55.150 --> 05:01.450
So pretty easy if we're going to be getting more into this in our project which we're going to get into

05:01.450 --> 05:02.430
in the next section.
