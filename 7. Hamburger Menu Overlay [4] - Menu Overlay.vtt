WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:05.430
All right guys so now we're gonna get started on the overlay with the list items.

00:05.550 --> 00:07.430
We have our toddler all set.

00:07.560 --> 00:15.510
So let's go down here and let's say menu wrap and let's style the menu class itself.

00:15.570 --> 00:29.880
So we're going to position this to fixed and set it to top 0 left 0 and set the width to 100 percent.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.260
We want to go all the way across.

00:31.260 --> 00:34.500
We also want to be 100 percent up and down.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.730
So basically like an overlay.

00:36.930 --> 00:44.270
Now initially we're going to want the visibility to be set to hit an OK.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.940
But if I do that now I won't be able to see it to style it.

00:46.950 --> 00:50.300
So I'm just going to comment that out for now we'll come back to it.

00:50.370 --> 00:59.420
Let's set the overflow to hidden and let's display this as flex because we want to center everything.

00:59.430 --> 01:12.690
So we'll say display flex and line items to the center and justify content to the center.

01:12.690 --> 01:13.070
All right.

01:13.100 --> 01:19.070
So go ahead and save that now you can see the list items are in the medal here.

01:19.200 --> 01:19.470
All right.

01:19.470 --> 01:26.010
So now we want to take care of the the menu overlay which is basically the the dark part.

01:26.100 --> 01:26.350
OK.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.170
So when we click this this this dark area right here.

01:31.170 --> 01:36.330
So for that we're going to take menu wrap.

01:36.900 --> 01:43.440
Same menu wrap menu and then it's going to be the direct div.

01:44.190 --> 01:44.440
OK.

01:44.580 --> 01:48.860
If you remember our menu class has to divs in it before the well.

01:48.870 --> 01:53.280
So we're targeting that first one and we're going to set a background.

01:53.430 --> 01:57.700
And I'm gonna use the primary color I'm sorry the overlay color.

02:00.070 --> 02:01.010
OK.

02:01.020 --> 02:08.310
Now if I save that you'll see that it's only overlaying the the the the menu itself.

02:08.310 --> 02:17.310
Now I'm going to set the width to 200 and I'm going to use viewport widths here and then height.

02:17.310 --> 02:23.190
I'm also going to set to 200 viewport widths.

02:23.250 --> 02:29.130
Now the reason for that is I wanted to extend pretty far.

02:29.130 --> 02:34.170
So when this is the finished one if I click this it extends you see how it scales up.

02:34.170 --> 02:41.130
It scales up to 200 viewport widths in both the height and the the width.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.340
So let's see now what we want to do.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.290
You can see that this stuff has disappeared.

02:46.440 --> 02:52.500
So we're gonna go ahead and say display flex

02:57.150 --> 02:59.670
and let's align.

03:00.270 --> 03:08.560
We want to line items to the center and also justify content to the center.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.770
And now it's back.

03:09.860 --> 03:12.600
So we're just three centering everything.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.140
Let's see next thing we want is to add a transition here

03:18.990 --> 03:25.710
and we're gonna do transition all zero point four seconds in ease.

03:25.710 --> 03:28.830
Now what we want to transition is the scale.

03:28.830 --> 03:31.770
So we want this to start off with a scale of zero.

03:31.770 --> 03:41.130
So let's say transform and then scale and we'll if we set this to zero and I save you'll see it disappears.

03:41.130 --> 03:45.760
So scale zero it's just it's not there it's scaled down to nothing.

03:46.050 --> 03:50.430
And then what we want to happen is when we click this we want it to scale upwards.

03:50.430 --> 03:55.160
So that's what's happening when you see this open it's scaling up and it's transitioning.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.720
However I can't see anything anymore.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.420
So again I'm going to just comment that out for now.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.450
Just so we can see this to style it.

04:03.780 --> 04:04.150
All right.

04:04.170 --> 04:09.420
Now let's see I think I think that's that's good for this div.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.970
Now the next one just copy this

04:14.520 --> 04:18.030
and it's paste that in and target the next div

04:21.380 --> 04:31.730
so let's see for this one we're going to text align center so we'll save that and I can see that these

04:31.730 --> 04:33.370
are aligned in the center.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.030
We're gonna do a Max

04:37.430 --> 04:46.540
with let's do 90 viewport widths so it wouldn't go beyond 90 viewport widths.

04:46.550 --> 04:49.340
And this is inside the dark inside this.

04:49.580 --> 04:58.080
The part where scaling in the max height we're going to set to 100 viewport heights.

04:58.080 --> 04:58.510
OK.

04:58.520 --> 05:03.030
And we're going to set opacity to zero.

05:03.060 --> 05:03.420
All right.

05:03.420 --> 05:08.980
Now if I save that it disappears so again I'm going to comment that so.

05:09.490 --> 05:09.760
OK.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.250
The parts that are that actually this basically the starting points.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.230
Nothing shows.

05:15.230 --> 05:21.280
So we need to comment all that stuff out for now and then when we're ready we'll bring it back in.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.570
Now see what else you want to do here.

05:24.570 --> 05:35.130
We need to add a transition and we want to transition the opacity now just to let you know what's going

05:35.130 --> 05:36.150
on here.

05:36.450 --> 05:41.910
When we click this you'll see that it scales up but then you see how that feeds in.

05:41.910 --> 05:45.590
It doesn't come in with the scale it feeds in afterwards.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.420
So that's the div that we're working with right now.

05:48.450 --> 05:54.010
So we want to transform the opacity to zero point four seconds ease.

05:55.020 --> 05:55.400
OK.

05:55.410 --> 06:04.250
So that way it'll just kind of fade in after this div scales in and then I think we should be good here.

06:04.290 --> 06:09.460
So let's go back and now let's start to style what this looks like here.

06:09.510 --> 06:11.830
So let's grab onto the the list items.

06:11.830 --> 06:19.850
I'm going to copy this and let's put this in and we're just going to use the angle brackets I know in

06:19.880 --> 06:25.980
order these cases we don't need to like right here but we'll just use it and we'll say well and then

06:26.020 --> 06:31.560
ally and then we're going to remove the bullet.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.370
So let's say list style none.

06:34.090 --> 06:34.490
OK.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.960
So that gets rid of the bullets.

06:37.740 --> 06:41.930
Let's set color to whites even though that's not going to change the link color.

06:41.940 --> 06:48.890
But just in case there is a list item that is not that is not a link.

06:49.320 --> 06:54.900
And then we can just inherit and we can just do color inherit for the tag and we're going to set the

06:54.900 --> 06:56.760
font size here.

06:56.820 --> 06:58.820
So it's a font size.

06:58.830 --> 07:07.070
Let's do one point five REM and let's do sets should be good.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.110
Let's save that so

07:15.400 --> 07:17.550
we need some padding here.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.030
That's two padding

07:22.210 --> 07:23.020
too.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.520
Oh that's too much.

07:24.520 --> 07:33.160
I'm kind of experimenting a little bit from my initial my initial one here because I use pixels and

07:33.160 --> 07:33.610
now.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.280
I want to use room.

07:35.350 --> 07:36.070
So that looks good.

07:36.070 --> 07:45.160
Now the links we've take care of those so it's copy this and let's say we want to target the tag and

07:45.160 --> 07:50.520
if we say color inherit and save that's there and it turned white.

07:50.530 --> 07:58.770
We also want to do text decoration none and save all right.

07:58.770 --> 08:06.540
Now for the hover I want to use the secondary colors when I just grabbed this and let's do coal and

08:06.540 --> 08:10.800
hover and let's say color far

08:15.740 --> 08:19.560
secondary color.

08:19.610 --> 08:23.540
All right so now when I hover over it we get that that secondary color.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.870
But I want it to be transition so I'm going to add to the link.

08:26.880 --> 08:40.710
A transition of well we'll just do color transition color zero point four seconds and ease snow you

08:40.720 --> 08:42.430
get that nice transition.

08:42.470 --> 08:45.530
So there's really only a couple things left to do.

08:45.530 --> 08:52.340
We need to hide all of this initially which basically we just need to UN comment the things that we've

08:52.340 --> 08:55.720
commented out and then we need to have an event.

08:55.730 --> 08:56.920
Well not it's on tech.

08:56.940 --> 08:59.060
Well I guess it is an event it's the checked event.

08:59.060 --> 09:04.790
When we check this out we want that stuff to show we want it to scale up.

09:04.790 --> 09:07.510
We want that first of to scale up the second div.

09:07.640 --> 09:11.220
We want to bring into opacity 1.

09:11.480 --> 09:16.040
And we also want to set the visibility from hidden to show.

09:16.070 --> 09:16.500
All right.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.000
I'm sorry.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.900
Visible.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.310
So let's UN comments opacity right here.

09:22.310 --> 09:29.690
So that's the the inner div and then scale is the outer div and then visible.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.560
The menu has visibility hidden.

09:31.560 --> 09:36.110
So we're going to uncommon to all of those and save and that's going to make it all disappear.

09:36.110 --> 09:39.050
So now we want it to come back when we click this.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.180
So we're going to add that stuff up here.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.010
So first one let's do

09:48.680 --> 09:50.450
a show menu.

09:50.450 --> 09:55.540
So we're going to say dot menu wrap.

09:55.990 --> 09:59.330
And this is all going to happen when the toddler is checked.

09:59.330 --> 10:03.720
So we simply want to do toddler checked.

10:03.770 --> 10:12.650
Now we want to target the class of menu and we can't do like dot menu like that because it's not within

10:12.890 --> 10:13.760
the toddler.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.120
Right.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.560
And we can't do that.

10:15.590 --> 10:21.160
We can't even do plus because it's not directly after the hamburgers directly after.

10:21.170 --> 10:27.440
So the way that we can target this menu from this checkbox is we're using the till day.

10:27.440 --> 10:27.930
OK.

10:27.950 --> 10:34.850
Which I can't remember if I actually showed you this before but we can use this to target something

10:34.850 --> 10:36.950
that precedes another element.

10:36.980 --> 10:43.490
So we want to grab the menu and we want to set that visibility too visible.

10:43.490 --> 10:43.760
OK.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.880
Because remember initially we set it to hidden.

10:46.880 --> 10:53.270
So now we're checking we're hitting the check thing and or the checkbox and we're setting menu to visibility

10:53.390 --> 10:56.000
visibility visible.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.730
Now we still can't see it because it's the inner div is scaled down.

11:01.740 --> 11:02.090
Right.

11:02.090 --> 11:07.400
So we have to add another basically another event with this toggle are checked.

11:07.400 --> 11:20.550
So we're going to grab this and we want to take that first div and transform scale.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.580
And we want to scale to 1.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.010
All right.

11:25.010 --> 11:28.850
And then let's add a transition

11:31.720 --> 11:36.110
duration and I'm going to use that menu speed.

11:36.220 --> 11:41.730
So let's say var dash dash menu dash speed.

11:41.730 --> 11:45.660
And let me just make sure I set that I did.

11:45.850 --> 11:46.150
All right.

11:46.180 --> 11:52.180
So if I save that case now that opens Oh you know what.

11:52.180 --> 11:57.880
We didn't make it circular so we didn't add the border radius where we sit we were supposed to.

11:57.880 --> 12:06.970
So we need to go to that first div and let's add border radius unless you want it to be square.

12:06.970 --> 12:09.460
But I think it looks cool as a circle.

12:09.460 --> 12:13.900
So it's a that's still not quite right.

12:15.720 --> 12:15.930
All right.

12:15.930 --> 12:18.450
I'll figure out what's wrong afterwards.

12:18.480 --> 12:28.310
Let's add the the last one which is going to let's go back up here the last one which is gonna set the.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.310
Which is going to bring the items in right.

12:30.330 --> 12:37.020
Because it's set to opacity 0 so we want to target those which is gonna be the inner div and we want

12:37.020 --> 12:38.340
to set opacity

12:41.280 --> 12:46.350
to 1 because it's initially set to zero and let's say transition

12:48.840 --> 13:00.240
opacity zero point four seconds ease and let's add a delay so we'll do zero point four seconds delay.

13:00.550 --> 13:08.430
OK so now we click that it's almost working but we have an issue with the circle here.

13:08.430 --> 13:12.690
So let me just see what what's going on here.

13:15.320 --> 13:21.550
All right guys so since this is in a flex the width is being affected.

13:21.550 --> 13:28.900
So all we have to do is in this initial div right here the directive after menu is add a property of

13:28.990 --> 13:29.890
flex none.

13:29.890 --> 13:33.940
So let's put this right here.

13:33.940 --> 13:42.160
So if we say flex nine and save and now let's reload the page so we click this and now it scales out

13:42.190 --> 13:43.060
all the way.

13:43.060 --> 13:47.400
And it's not it's not bound into the the window here.

13:47.410 --> 13:47.670
All right.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.030
Cool so let's bring it out.

13:50.270 --> 13:51.270
Still looks good.

13:51.270 --> 13:53.400
Let's bring it in.

13:53.450 --> 13:53.840
Good.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.820
I mean we can still see the circle.

13:56.090 --> 14:02.340
And like I said if you want to extend this like you could at a media query and extend this to like 300

14:07.030 --> 14:07.290
yes.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.090
So now you don't have that effect.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.920
But it takes longer Oh it doesn't take longer.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.400
But it goes does it go fast.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.360
Looks like it's going faster.

14:20.380 --> 14:21.010
No it's not.

14:21.040 --> 14:26.160
So you could you can increase that if you don't like the circle.

14:26.250 --> 14:31.350
You know when it's on smaller screens but I think it's fine.

14:31.350 --> 14:33.070
I think it looks cool.

14:33.070 --> 14:33.360
All right.

14:33.370 --> 14:39.490
So that's it guys hopefully you enjoyed this little project in like I said feel free to use this in

14:40.150 --> 14:42.010
you know future projects.

14:42.010 --> 14:48.820
It's a nice little subtle menu and you could basically attach it to any UI or any Web site.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.020
And like I said if you want to try and turn this into a full fledged web site using this menu maybe

14:56.020 --> 14:58.540
that could be a little challenge for you.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.140
But that's it.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.460
I'll see you in the next video.
