00:00.410 --> 00:05.910
All right guys so in this video I just want to go over a couple small things that I missed that I feel

00:05.910 --> 00:08.220
are important for you guys to know.

00:08.280 --> 00:13.950
So this is kind of just an aside and I just have a file called index H Temple and I'm going to just

00:13.950 --> 00:24.360
generate my Boulder boilerplate here and let's just say test file and we'll put in our style tags and

00:24.360 --> 00:31.170
then in the body I'm just going to have an H1 and I'm just going to say hello world and a paragraph

00:31.170 --> 00:38.550
underneath with let's say 15 words and we'll go ahead and openness and the first thing I want to talk

00:38.550 --> 00:40.500
about is visibility.

00:40.500 --> 00:47.910
OK so we looked at the display property where we could display block display inline inline block later

00:47.910 --> 00:50.920
on we're going to look at display flex display grid.

00:50.970 --> 00:58.050
There's also something called display none which will just remove the element from the browser completely.

00:58.050 --> 01:06.240
So I'm going to take the H1 and I'm going to set display to none and save.

01:06.270 --> 01:08.070
And notice it completely goes away.

01:08.070 --> 01:14.340
So this can be very useful especially when it comes to building responsive Web sites and responsive

01:14.370 --> 01:20.470
applications because sometimes you might want something not to show on mobile screens.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.720
So this comes in handy.

01:21.720 --> 01:26.180
Now there's also a property called visibility.

01:26.640 --> 01:33.660
OK so we can set visibility to hidden and I'm going to save that notice it goes away but the big difference

01:33.660 --> 01:37.080
here is that it still takes up the space.

01:37.080 --> 01:37.390
OK.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.320
Display none.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.960
We'll just completely remove it from what's called the Document Object Model.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.690
Visibility just basically makes it disappear or makes it invisible.

01:47.970 --> 01:50.130
It's still there in terms of the space.

01:50.320 --> 01:50.570
OK.

01:50.580 --> 01:55.260
So that's the big difference between these two you're going to find yourself using this much much more

01:55.260 --> 01:58.980
than this but it's still important to know that that's available.

01:58.980 --> 02:06.710
All right so the next thing I want to look at is the order of precedence and also the important flag.

02:06.720 --> 02:14.340
So basically if I take this H1 here and I give it a color of blue I save that.

02:14.340 --> 02:25.530
Obviously it's going to turn blue but if I give this a class of let's just say hello and up here I say

02:25.590 --> 02:34.310
dot hello and give that a color of red and save it turns red.

02:34.310 --> 02:41.840
So normally the further down the style is that that's what's going to take precedence however targeting

02:41.840 --> 02:47.370
a class is going to override targeting the actual element.

02:47.390 --> 02:54.680
And if I take this class of how low and I move it above the H1 you might think that while now it's going

02:54.680 --> 03:00.950
to be fixed this you might think now it's gonna be blue because this is further down.

03:00.950 --> 03:03.210
However if I save it's still red.

03:03.380 --> 03:09.770
And the reason for that is is having a specific class and targeting that it's going to override just

03:09.770 --> 03:12.110
the H1 itself.

03:12.110 --> 03:12.490
All right.

03:12.500 --> 03:25.120
Now I just want to put this back how I had it like that and if you come to a situation where you in

03:25.130 --> 03:31.250
this might happen if you're dealing with other style sheets maybe you're using some kind of CSX framework

03:31.250 --> 03:38.110
and you're bringing an external style sheets as well and you want your style to override another style

03:38.150 --> 03:40.130
you can use the important flag.

03:40.130 --> 03:44.760
So right here where we sit color blue I'm just going to add onto the end of this.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.510
I'm going to add an exclamation and then the word important.

03:48.990 --> 03:49.340
OK.

03:49.340 --> 03:56.120
Now if I save this you can see now it's blue because this this important flag is going to say it doesn't

03:56.120 --> 04:02.030
matter if there's a class of hello or anything else and nothing else matters this should take precedence.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.170
OK.

04:03.200 --> 04:09.410
And the only way that that this is going to work is if I also put important on this which is stupid

04:09.410 --> 04:13.740
and defeats the purpose but just to show you that it works.

04:13.940 --> 04:16.130
We'll go ahead and save that and that will be red.

04:17.240 --> 04:17.900
All right bring in.

04:17.960 --> 04:18.990
Get rid of that.

04:19.010 --> 04:21.500
I do want to keep that though.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.170
Just see you guys have it for reference.

04:24.200 --> 04:24.530
All right.

04:24.530 --> 04:29.360
And then the last thing I want to mention for now if I remember anything else that I forgot I'll come

04:29.360 --> 04:30.140
back to this.

04:30.140 --> 04:37.520
This this video and edited it but is is negative margin values we went over margin we went we met went

04:37.520 --> 04:43.490
over padding but we didn't go over negative margin values which you really should try to avoid if you

04:43.490 --> 04:49.100
can but it is possible so of course we can take this H1.

04:49.340 --> 04:57.650
So let's work in the class down here we'll say margin dash top and we say 30 pixels and save and it

04:57.650 --> 05:04.310
gets pushed down 30 pixels but at the same time we can also do negative 30 pixels and that will just

05:04.310 --> 05:05.990
bring it upwards.

05:05.990 --> 05:06.310
OK.

05:06.320 --> 05:13.970
And you can do the same thing like Let's do margin let's do left.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.770
Negative 30 pixels.

05:15.770 --> 05:18.880
And what it should do is pull it this way save.

05:18.890 --> 05:20.480
And there it goes that way.

05:20.480 --> 05:20.720
All right.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.270
So you can have negative values with margins.

05:23.330 --> 05:24.940
However you can't do it with padding.

05:24.950 --> 05:33.890
If I do it with padding and save that's not going to work OK because remember padding is inside the

05:33.920 --> 05:35.510
border.

05:35.540 --> 05:35.860
All right.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.920
So those are the main things that I wanted to mention.

05:38.930 --> 05:42.890
So we'll move on and let's start our hotel website project.
