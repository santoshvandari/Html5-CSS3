00:00.290 --> 00:04.980
All right guys so in the last video we finished the home article section here.

00:04.980 --> 00:09.580
Now we're going to start to work on the footer which is also going to be a great container.

00:09.570 --> 00:17.440
So let's go below the section here and we'll just say footer and let's give it a footer tag with an

00:17.550 --> 00:21.880
I.D. of main dash footer.

00:21.970 --> 00:22.380
All right.

00:22.380 --> 00:26.780
And then inside here we're gonna have the container class to move everything to the middle.

00:26.780 --> 00:34.230
I'm also going to add a class of foot container here which will be the actual grid container.

00:34.230 --> 00:41.340
And inside here we're gonna have basically have five divs if we look at the project here we're gonna

00:41.340 --> 00:46.340
set it to repeat for one at far so it has one two three four.

00:46.620 --> 00:49.410
And then the next one gets knocked on to the next line.

00:49.410 --> 00:53.080
Now this last one here we want to span across all the way.

00:53.130 --> 00:53.460
Okay.

00:53.490 --> 01:01.860
So we're gonna add a grid span as well so let's add our first div which is going to have that light

01:02.340 --> 01:05.390
logo so we're gonna say image.

01:05.520 --> 01:12.930
The source is going to be in the image folder and it's going to be this logo liked PMG.

01:12.970 --> 01:16.890
OK we'll just say news news grid.

01:16.890 --> 01:25.200
And then underneath that I'm going to put a paragraph excuse me and we'll say let's do Lorem 30 let's

01:25.200 --> 01:27.420
do 20 and I think that's what I want.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.480
So that's the first div.

01:29.490 --> 01:39.650
And the next one is going to be the email newsletter so let's do an h three and say e-mail news newsletter

01:41.390 --> 01:50.040
and then we're gonna do a paragraph let's say Lorem will do alarm 8 and under the paragraph we're gonna

01:50.070 --> 01:51.850
have a little form.

01:52.110 --> 01:53.850
We want to get rid of the action

01:56.680 --> 01:58.910
inside here we're gonna have an input.

01:58.940 --> 02:05.960
Let's give it a type of email since this is gonna be an email field we don't need name and I.D. We will

02:05.960 --> 02:09.040
put a place holder.

02:11.420 --> 02:18.550
And we'll say enter we'll say enter email and then we want to submit button.

02:18.560 --> 02:29.120
So I'm going to do an input with the type of submit and for the value will say subscribe and let's also

02:29.120 --> 02:38.270
give this a class of B T N and I want to do B T N and primary All right.

02:38.270 --> 02:45.680
So the next thing we want is the links here so these site links which aren't going to go anywhere but

02:45.830 --> 02:50.090
it's just for just for the aesthetics of the site.

02:50.090 --> 02:58.180
So let's say div and we're gonna have an H 3 and just say site links and then a.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.140
Well now this.

02:59.210 --> 03:05.150
Well I'm going to style I'm going to give a class of list and I want it to be basically like a utility

03:05.540 --> 03:08.780
class so that we can use this in other places as well.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.880
And as far as the list items go we're gonna have links to just nowhere.

03:13.940 --> 03:18.770
This first one is gonna be help and support.

03:18.770 --> 03:28.160
Copy this down a couple of times four times and let's do privacy policy.

03:28.170 --> 03:31.010
It's just some common pages you see on Web sites.

03:31.190 --> 03:33.160
We'll do about us.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.870
And this one here.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.890
Let's do contact.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.100
OK.

03:39.110 --> 03:44.610
Now the next grid item is gonna be a dev as well.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.690
And this is gonna be that the join our club.

03:47.780 --> 03:58.790
So we're gonna do an H TO AN H two and I'll say join our club and then let's put a paragraph and we'll

03:58.790 --> 04:08.600
do Lorem 10 and then under that will have an A tag with the class of B10 and class of B T N secondary

04:10.910 --> 04:16.270
and let's just say in here we'll say Join Now.

04:16.530 --> 04:16.900
Okay.

04:16.910 --> 04:24.400
And then the final div is just gonna be a paragraph and in that paragraph will say copyright.

04:24.470 --> 04:29.570
Let's do Ampersand copy semicolon which will give us a little copyright symbol.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.400
Twenty nineteen.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.920
All rights reserved.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.150
All right.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.590
So that's all of our each team Al.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.200
Let's check it out.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.300
So it's gonna look very very ugly.

04:39.410 --> 04:46.310
So we'll head over to our CSX and we have some utility classes to create but we're going to just start

04:46.310 --> 04:47.990
on the footer itself first.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.300
So it's a footer.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.900
We have an I.D..

04:52.010 --> 04:56.220
We have an idea of main dash footer.

04:56.390 --> 05:04.970
Now the footer I'm going to give the dark color as it's background so far let's do dash dash.

05:04.970 --> 05:09.670
Dark color and let's make the actual color of the text white.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.930
OK so save that.

05:13.190 --> 05:18.040
Now the image is obviously way too big so let's say main dash image

05:20.950 --> 05:24.930
not main image mean footer and then target the image.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.110
And we want to set the width too.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.490
Let's do one hundred and fifty pixels.

05:30.730 --> 05:31.130
All right.

05:31.140 --> 05:33.150
And I want all the links to be white.

05:33.150 --> 05:41.550
So let's say main footer all the tags we want the color to be white.

05:41.550 --> 05:48.420
And now we're going to work on the grid and aligning these we want them to go in obviously we want to

05:48.420 --> 05:49.460
create some columns.

05:49.470 --> 05:56.830
So we're going to say main footer and we're gonna grab onto the footer dash container and we're gonna

05:56.850 --> 05:59.800
say display grid.

06:00.060 --> 06:09.350
And then as far as the grid template columns we're gonna do repeat and let's repeat four times one fraction.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.650
And let's add a grid gap.

06:12.930 --> 06:18.440
Spread them apart a little bit so we'll say one point five REM and save.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.430
And now you can see that they're all aligned.

06:21.510 --> 06:27.630
Now we have some some other designed to do styling to do like this.

06:27.630 --> 06:30.810
This form here also the list.

06:30.810 --> 06:34.620
But this last one here this this copy right.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.510
I want this to span all the way across.

06:36.540 --> 06:47.340
So I'm going to target that by saying main footer and let's let's say we want from the footer container

06:47.850 --> 06:52.200
a direct element to that is the last child.

06:52.200 --> 06:58.710
So even if it wasn't a div it doesn't matter what what kind of element we're going to target it and

06:58.710 --> 07:03.480
then we're gonna set the background to do four four four.

07:03.630 --> 07:08.550
And if we save that you can see it's stuck in here so we want to span it all the way across.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.200
And you guys remember how to do that.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.810
We're gonna do grid dash column

07:15.840 --> 07:21.250
and we want to start at the first column and then we want to span across four.

07:21.330 --> 07:22.560
We have four total.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.580
So we'll save that.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.780
And now it spans all the way across.

07:25.860 --> 07:32.470
Let's just add a little bit of padding here we'll see.

07:32.470 --> 07:35.710
Point five Ram.

07:35.860 --> 07:39.610
Let's also text aligned to the center

07:42.610 --> 07:49.840
and I want to make the font size just a little smaller so we're gonna do zero point seven five REM and

07:49.840 --> 07:51.680
save.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.020
All right.

07:52.060 --> 07:59.730
So let's see the footer itself.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.360
Actually you know what.

08:00.370 --> 08:03.370
Let's add a padding class to the footer.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.750
So up here we'll say.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.070
Class.

08:06.070 --> 08:09.490
Remember we have the P Y which is top and bottom.

08:09.490 --> 08:13.050
We'll do PE y to and save.

08:13.060 --> 08:17.790
So now this right here the form the little email form I want to style that.

08:17.800 --> 08:29.120
So let's target main footer and let's do photo container.

08:29.120 --> 08:36.430
And we're gonna grab the input and I'm gonna say I want the input that has the type that is equal to

08:36.500 --> 08:50.170
e-mail OK and I'm going to set the width to 90 percent and let's set padding say zero point five room

08:50.770 --> 08:56.820
and let's do a margin bottom of point five.

08:57.890 --> 08:59.200
All right so we'll save that.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.600
So that looks pretty good.

09:00.600 --> 09:08.560
Now for this for this button here I just want to set that with to 90 percent as well.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.420
So remember that main footer

09:14.830 --> 09:24.220
that's an input and we want to say where that type is equal to submit and then I just want to set the

09:24.250 --> 09:32.290
width to 90 percent which didn't mark because we needed a semicolon.

09:32.790 --> 09:33.080
OK.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.190
So that looks pretty good.

09:35.230 --> 09:42.770
One thing that I forgot to do is for the paragraphs I want all paragraphs to have a little bit of margin.

09:42.910 --> 09:48.240
You see how this is so close right here and right here so I'm just gonna add.

09:48.420 --> 09:55.270
Let's go up top here to like our core styles and let's put in paragraph and we'll say for the margin

09:55.270 --> 09:59.500
top and bottom we want to do point 5 room.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.220
So it just adds a little bit of space.

10:03.220 --> 10:03.520
All right.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.720
So I think that looks pretty good.

10:05.770 --> 10:12.130
Let's handle the list now like I said I want to be able to use the List class and other places as well

10:12.130 --> 10:15.010
so we're going to you add this as a utility class.

10:15.020 --> 10:22.860
So let's go see we'll go right under the padding here and let's say Don list.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.050
Actually we don't need to style the list itself.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.130
The usual let's just do the ally.

10:27.370 --> 10:33.560
And I just want to add padding I'll say point five room top and bottom.

10:34.000 --> 10:44.770
And let's add a border bottom of five five five dotted one pixel and then I want to set the width to

10:44.800 --> 10:47.530
90 percent and save.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.880
OK so that looks pretty good.

10:51.370 --> 10:51.910
All right.

10:52.740 --> 10:53.150
Oh you know what.

10:53.170 --> 10:54.460
Let's you and me.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.220
Let's do a hover state.

10:56.260 --> 10:59.880
Let's make the hover the primary colors so we'll see a list.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.920
Let's do we want to do dot list ally a

11:08.960 --> 11:16.960
hover and let's say we want the color to be var primary color.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.550
And now.

11:18.830 --> 11:19.380
Okay.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.750
That's not working.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.430
Not sure why that's not working.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.830
We've list ally a hover.

11:28.890 --> 11:32.770
Let's add an important flag here.

11:32.970 --> 11:34.070
See if that works.

11:34.080 --> 11:34.290
All right.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.830
There we go.

11:35.870 --> 11:36.170
OK.

11:36.180 --> 11:38.030
So that's our list styling.

11:38.220 --> 11:39.560
And I think that's it.

11:39.570 --> 11:41.040
I think that's it for the footer.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.420
So in the next video we're going to start to work on the inner pages.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.820
We have an about page.

11:46.830 --> 11:53.640
We also have an article page so we'll create those and then we'll start to work on the the mobile version

11:53.640 --> 11:54.630
for the Web site.
