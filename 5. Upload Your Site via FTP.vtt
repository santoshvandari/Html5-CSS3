WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:00.520
All right.

00:00.540 --> 00:03.570
So now it's time to actually upload our Web site.

00:03.600 --> 00:09.900
So if we go to our domain name obviously yours is different but mine is edge ledger dot net.

00:09.900 --> 00:13.500
We're just going to see the emotion just place holder.

00:13.620 --> 00:17.270
So we obviously want to replace this with the Web site that we built.

00:17.280 --> 00:24.160
So we're gonna go down to words as files and we want to click on FTB accounts.

00:24.160 --> 00:31.860
OK FCP stands for File Transfer Protocol and it's an Internet protocol that's used for file transfer.

00:31.890 --> 00:35.200
That's the I guess that's the easiest way I can put it.

00:35.310 --> 00:38.650
And right here we can put it in just like with the e-mail accounts.

00:38.670 --> 00:39.720
Any name we want.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.340
I'm just gonna do Brad and it's gonna be at edu ledger dot that year will be different obviously.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.820
And then a password.

00:46.830 --> 00:51.000
So just put in a password here

00:54.210 --> 00:56.010
and this is really important.

00:56.010 --> 01:03.270
So the directory by default it's going to put it into this this FCP account will go to just a separate

01:03.270 --> 01:05.880
folder called Brad which is not very useful.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.650
We want to actually go to the root of the of the Web site so that we can access the root page here.

01:12.690 --> 01:18.900
So we're going to just clear all of this out like that and you can also set a quota if you want and

01:18.930 --> 01:19.740
upload quota.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.290
But we're just going to keep on limited and then let's click creative to FTB account and now that's

01:25.290 --> 01:28.230
been created now to access our file.

01:28.230 --> 01:33.840
We need to we need to FCP client and I would highly recommend file zilla.

01:33.930 --> 01:42.120
So if we just search for file Zilla it's gonna be this right here file Zilla project dot org and you

01:42.120 --> 01:48.120
want to make sure you get the client not the server the server is if you want to have your own FTB server.

01:48.120 --> 01:54.340
So you just want to click download here and download and it's for Mac Windows Linux it's cross platform.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.850
So just grab that once it's installed you can open it up I already have installed so I'm just going

01:59.850 --> 02:09.030
to open it up here and you're going to see what you're gonna see something like this and over here on

02:09.030 --> 02:13.410
this side is your local machine as you can see it's showing my desktop right here.

02:13.410 --> 02:18.540
These are the folders I have on my desktop which includes the edge ledger Web site that we built.

02:18.540 --> 02:25.590
So if I go in there you'll see the R H team I'll file USS image javascript DSA store is just a hidden

02:25.590 --> 02:27.720
Mac file so don't worry about that.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.640
If you're on Windows you won't even have that.

02:30.540 --> 02:35.770
But what we're gonna do now is log in to our Web site through FTB.

02:35.790 --> 02:38.750
So up here in the host We want to put our domain name.

02:38.760 --> 02:45.930
So I'm going to use edge ledger dot net.

02:45.930 --> 02:53.940
And then the user name is going to be whatever your FTE account is mine is Brad at edged ledger dot

02:53.970 --> 02:55.160
net.

02:55.620 --> 03:06.060
And then the password that we used what was it and then port you can leave that blank the default port

03:06.060 --> 03:07.770
for FTB is twenty one.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.320
But if you leave it blank it's still going to use 21.

03:10.350 --> 03:16.200
So we don't need to put it in and then quick connect and you might get a box that says like authorize

03:16.200 --> 03:21.060
or something the first time you try to log in just say OK or authorize or whatever.

03:21.060 --> 03:26.990
Now what we're looking at here is the root of our entire server or I should say our account.

03:27.210 --> 03:33.180
And the place where you want to go to for your website is public HDMI out.

03:33.260 --> 03:33.530
OK.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.300
This public underscore each team.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.100
This is our actual website.

03:37.110 --> 03:45.420
So if we go into there what we're gonna see is a couple of files and the default dot H T M OK so could

03:45.420 --> 03:47.460
be each team out or each team.

03:47.670 --> 03:52.230
That is the the landing page that we see that coming soon page.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.860
So what we want to do is delete everything in here.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.440
We're just gonna delete all of this.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.190
So we'll say yes to the confirmation.

04:01.200 --> 04:06.900
And then if I go back to edge ledger dot net and reload we're just going to see this this blank index

04:06.930 --> 04:07.590
of.

04:07.740 --> 04:08.150
OK.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.110
So there's no files here.

04:10.110 --> 04:16.260
So we want to go to files Zilla and just bring all of our Web site files not the D.S. store but our

04:16.260 --> 04:23.100
Web site files right over we can just drag and drop and it's simply going to upload them to our host.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.070
OK.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.130
So it's all done.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.780
So there's only a couple of files so it doesn't take long.

04:28.530 --> 04:34.230
And then if we go back to our domain and reload there's our Web site.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.230
So our Web site is now live on the Internet

04:40.470 --> 04:42.160
and it's easy as that.

04:42.180 --> 04:48.810
Now FCP is when you start to get into application development when you're building these larger apps

04:49.570 --> 04:51.660
FCP is not really efficient.

04:51.660 --> 04:52.950
It's very slow.

04:52.980 --> 04:59.040
You probably want to start to learn about get in using SSD age using the control panel stuff like that

04:59.760 --> 05:04.940
but that's later on down the road for now if you're just building small business Web sites each team

05:04.940 --> 05:07.470
all CSA is a little front end Javascript.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.240
I mean FCP is fine.

05:09.330 --> 05:16.710
So now that you know how to purchase shared hosting account create e-mail accounts create RTP upload

05:16.710 --> 05:20.850
your site in the next video we're gonna start to learn more about CSX.

05:20.850 --> 05:22.960
We're going to start to learn about transitions and stuff.

05:22.960 --> 05:27.990
We're gonna start to look at the grid system and then we're going to build some more projects.

05:27.990 --> 05:33.290
I'm also going to show you how to deploy to a static host called Net lo fi a little later on.

05:33.330 --> 05:33.630
All right.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.190
So I'll see you in the next section.
