WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:00.650
All right.

00:00.660 --> 00:05.240
So in the last video we did the team El for our presentation project.

00:05.240 --> 00:10.840
Now we're gonna start on the CSX in our style dot CSX is already being included.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.700
So make sure you have your link to your style she right here.

00:14.730 --> 00:20.580
So first thing I want to do is set some variables so let's set for the route scope.

00:20.580 --> 00:28.970
I just want to have the colors for each page and also the animation speed.

00:28.990 --> 00:33.990
OK because in the beginning when the landing page loads we'll have the heading come in from the top

00:34.700 --> 00:40.170
paragraph come coming from the side and we want to say we want that speed to be inside of a variable

00:40.170 --> 00:48.600
so let's say dash dash page dash 1 dash color and I'm going to set this to steel blue.

00:48.600 --> 00:54.930
I'm going to use color names and let's do actual just copy this down.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.430
So do shift option or shift all on Windows.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.920
And then the down key.

01:00.060 --> 01:05.010
Let's do we need four of them because this four pages and of course you could add more if you wanted

01:05.010 --> 01:06.440
to more or less.

01:06.720 --> 01:22.680
So three and four and let's see for page two let's do 10 and we'll do teal and let's do slate blue

01:25.490 --> 01:32.850
which is almost the purple and then I'm just going to add a variable called an inmate dash speed so

01:32.850 --> 01:37.660
we can easily change the speed of the animation I'm going to set that to one second.

01:37.670 --> 01:39.260
All right so those are our variables.

01:39.260 --> 01:49.030
Next thing I'm going to do is the body style so for the body let's do font family.

01:49.430 --> 01:58.020
And I'm just going to use aerial for this and then let's do line height usually like to do about one

01:58.020 --> 02:06.510
point four for the body line height color is gonna be white by default and then let's zero out the margin

02:06.840 --> 02:09.380
in padding.

02:10.090 --> 02:10.410
OK.

02:10.410 --> 02:17.460
Now I don't want scroll bars to show that's that's a big part of the curve of how I want this Web site

02:17.460 --> 02:17.940
to work.

02:17.940 --> 02:23.010
So we want to say overflow and we want to set that too hidden.

02:23.120 --> 02:23.360
OK.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.980
So no scroll bars will show on the body.

02:26.070 --> 02:32.580
So if I save that it's going to look like this which we can't see the text anymore because the text

02:32.580 --> 02:33.900
is white.

02:34.050 --> 02:39.000
So I think that we should implement the page colors.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.190
So let's go down here.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.390
Let's put a comment let's say page colors.

02:44.850 --> 02:48.430
And basically we're going to tack on to the I.D..

02:48.750 --> 02:49.140
OK.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.630
All sections have a class of page.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.330
So this is all stuff they'll share.

02:53.340 --> 02:58.410
Styles they'll share but the ideas are unique and that's where we want the colors.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.250
So let's do I.D..

03:00.270 --> 03:09.100
Page One and I'm just going to do background I'm going to set it to var dash dash.

03:09.220 --> 03:17.120
Page ups page dash 1 dash color.

03:17.310 --> 03:17.610
All right.

03:17.610 --> 03:20.660
And then I'll copy this line down couple more times.

03:20.700 --> 03:25.320
This one will be two three four.

03:25.350 --> 03:30.170
And then we want to change the I.D. to three and four.

03:30.270 --> 03:35.220
So this way it's easy just to change the colors if you change you know if you want to have something

03:35.220 --> 03:38.620
different for a background of a certain page.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.910
So if we save this you'll see that now each each page has the different background color.

03:44.910 --> 03:46.740
Now for the pages themselves each.

03:46.740 --> 03:50.540
Every single one we're gonna want to take up the whole viewport.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.000
Right.

03:51.000 --> 04:02.810
So let's add in our page class down here and let's display as flex.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.700
As soon as I do that everything's going to go in a row.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.860
It's going to go horizontal which I don't want.

04:07.890 --> 04:11.980
So I want to say flex dash direction.

04:12.030 --> 04:17.280
I want to be a column and then it'll go back to going vertical.

04:17.550 --> 04:22.110
And then let's set the height for 100 viewport heights.

04:22.110 --> 04:26.220
And then when I save it's only going to show the first page.

04:26.220 --> 04:26.480
OK.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.220
Now we want to align this stuff.

04:28.230 --> 04:37.110
So let's say a line dash items and let's say center center.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.030
And that's going to align it harm horizontal into the center.

04:41.060 --> 04:50.550
And then let's do justify dash content to the center and save.

04:50.550 --> 04:54.540
And now it's a line both horizontal and vertical.

04:54.840 --> 05:03.840
And then I'm just going to add I'm also going to text align center so the text itself and then I'm gonna

05:03.870 --> 05:07.730
add a little padding on the left and right so zero top and bottom.

05:07.740 --> 05:13.060
And let's do four REM left and right just so it's not right up against the edge.

05:13.280 --> 05:13.610
All right.

05:13.620 --> 05:18.090
Now the heading in the paragraph I want to be a little bigger.

05:18.160 --> 05:33.240
So let's target the page each excuse me and let's set the font size let's set it to four REM and I just

05:33.240 --> 05:38.640
want to change the line height to one point two.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.760
I'm gonna add a margin of one room.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.080
All right.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.820
So let's save that.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.740
Excuse me.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.430
So that looks pretty good.

05:48.450 --> 05:55.200
The paragraph I also want to be a little bigger so let's target the page paragraph and we'll set the

05:55.200 --> 05:57.990
font size.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.770
Let's do one point three rams.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.890
So we'll make it a little larger.

06:03.930 --> 06:04.280
All right.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.470
Now let's do the button.

06:07.800 --> 06:20.040
OK so the button here so has a class of B10 and we want to display it as an inline block as far as padding.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.860
It's gonna be a pretty big button so we'll do one room top and bottom two left in right.

06:25.860 --> 06:32.110
Let's make the background light by default.

06:32.130 --> 06:36.940
You could put that in a variable if you wanted to but I think it's fine.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.610
And then let's do color.

06:39.890 --> 06:47.010
We'll do three three three for the text color and if it's a length we want to take away the text decoration

06:47.400 --> 06:56.580
make that none we should also add board or none and then let's do margin dash top one room just to push

06:56.580 --> 07:03.060
it down a little bit and then the font size I'm going to make a little bigger so we'll do one point

07:03.060 --> 07:08.660
one room member one room by default is gonna be 16 pixels.

07:09.270 --> 07:09.540
OK.

07:09.540 --> 07:16.940
Now when we hover over this I wanted to change to a dark color but I also wanted to transition.

07:16.950 --> 07:24.210
So I'm going to add a transition to all and it's going to be really quick let's say zero point three

07:24.210 --> 07:27.630
seconds and we'll say ease in.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.970
So that doesn't do anything because we don't have a hover yet.

07:31.050 --> 07:41.700
So let's add a Beatty in coal and hover and I want the background to be dark and the color to be light

07:45.240 --> 07:46.360
so if I saved that.

07:46.390 --> 07:52.230
And now when I hover over it you'll see it transitions to dark rather than just clicking or you know

07:52.470 --> 07:56.930
just immediately switching to a dark color.

07:56.970 --> 08:03.990
Now let's see we also want to have a dark version of the button and I want it to be this exact styling.

08:03.990 --> 08:08.920
So what I'll do is I'll just put a comma here and I'll just say for Beatty n dash dark.

08:08.940 --> 08:16.230
We want to have this styling and then for the B10 dark cover it's going to go ahead and copy this.

08:16.230 --> 08:21.480
So Beatty and dark hover is going to be the opposite.

08:21.510 --> 08:31.710
So the background will be light and the color will be dark.

08:31.790 --> 08:32.360
All right.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.840
And if I click it you'll see it goes to the next page.

08:34.870 --> 08:40.180
So I can now I can navigate up and down the pages we don't have the scrolling effect with Jake Query

08:40.190 --> 08:40.880
yet.

08:40.880 --> 08:46.460
And it's up to you if you want to include that or not I'm going to but you don't need to it'll just

08:46.520 --> 08:48.260
switch like this.

08:48.260 --> 08:48.560
All right.

08:48.590 --> 08:53.510
So I think we're going to stop here and then in the next video we're going to add our animation and

08:53.510 --> 08:54.290
we want this.

08:54.290 --> 08:56.480
This heading to come in from the top.

08:56.510 --> 09:02.000
This to come in from the side and then we'll also implement a little bit of J query to add the scrolling

09:02.000 --> 09:02.480
effect.
