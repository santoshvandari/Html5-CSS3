00:00.210 --> 00:06.150
All right guys in the last video we went ahead and dealt with the boxes we created these boxes with

00:06.150 --> 00:07.620
these arrows.

00:07.620 --> 00:09.370
But this is not.

00:09.870 --> 00:11.730
This is not responsive.

00:11.790 --> 00:15.650
I can see that it's just the same no matter what the screen size is.

00:15.660 --> 00:18.370
So I want to add a couple of media queries.

00:18.390 --> 00:23.040
So in the CSX file let's go down here and let's say media.

00:23.490 --> 00:28.530
And this is gonna be a max width of 900 pixels.

00:28.530 --> 00:36.270
So basically when it's when it's less 900 pixels or less I want the width of the boxes to change from

00:36.270 --> 00:38.940
400 to two hundred and fifty pixels wide.

00:38.970 --> 00:49.290
So we're gonna say timeline you l l I div and let's set the width to two hundred and fifty pixels which

00:49.290 --> 00:51.090
were originally 400.

00:51.090 --> 00:55.800
So now when I hit nine hundred which is right here they change.

00:55.800 --> 01:03.030
Now we have an issue with the left side where it's too far out so we can fix that really easily by just

01:03.570 --> 01:06.680
taking the C ally.

01:06.690 --> 01:16.980
We want to do and child and we want to grab the even which is the left side and grab that div and then

01:16.980 --> 01:25.980
just move it over so we'll say from the left we want to do negative two eighty four pixels and save.

01:25.980 --> 01:27.990
And that brings it over all right.

01:27.990 --> 01:32.580
Now when you're creating this stuff from scratch you're going to be you're gonna be experimenting a

01:32.580 --> 01:33.540
lot.

01:33.810 --> 01:38.490
You're not going to know these values right away so you weren't going to be experimenting when it comes

01:38.490 --> 01:45.180
to like the border and in making these arrows it took me a while to to figure out exactly what values

01:45.180 --> 01:46.230
to use.

01:46.260 --> 01:50.970
OK so just keep that in mind it's not it's not always going to go as smooth as you see in courses and

01:50.970 --> 01:52.620
tutorials.

01:52.620 --> 01:52.950
All right.

01:52.950 --> 01:56.420
Now that is if it's under 900.

01:56.430 --> 01:59.370
Now if we get to like right here it's still it's not.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.700
It doesn't look good.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.680
And what I want to do is move them all to the to the right side.

02:04.680 --> 02:10.040
And I want this line basically the list item to be on the side here.

02:10.110 --> 02:10.430
OK.

02:10.440 --> 02:18.060
So let's add another media query and let's say Max with let's make it.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.830
Let's do six hundred pixels.

02:21.090 --> 02:29.700
So basically smartphones and we're going to take the time line you well ally and this is set to margin

02:29.790 --> 02:31.130
Auto on the left and right.

02:31.140 --> 02:38.300
If we go up here and we look at the ally we have auto for left and right.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.730
But I don't want it in the middle anymore I want it on the side.

02:41.730 --> 02:53.140
So I'm just going to simply set the margin left to 20 pixels and save and that does nothing that's because

02:53.140 --> 02:54.310
I'm not 600 yet.

02:54.310 --> 02:55.510
So if we go there we go.

02:55.510 --> 03:02.380
So at six hundred you can see that the the line gets pushed over to the left and it's it's margin left

03:02.380 --> 03:03.140
20.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.770
We don't want to do zero because it'll be right up against the edge.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.470
So margin left 20.

03:08.500 --> 03:13.840
And if you're confused of why that happened again it's because we had margin auto which puts it in the

03:13.840 --> 03:14.520
middle.

03:14.530 --> 03:21.090
Now we changed margin left to 20 pixels which makes it no longer margin auto.

03:21.100 --> 03:21.410
OK.

03:21.430 --> 03:29.530
So let's move on to the width of the boxes and I know that you can't see the the other side the left

03:29.530 --> 03:36.640
side boxes we're going to fix that but I want the width to actually be a calculation meaning I want

03:36.640 --> 03:46.990
it to be to be dynamic so let's say timeline you l ally div and let's set the width instead of using

03:46.990 --> 03:53.620
just a fixed number I'm going to use the C Ss calc calc function here and we can say we want to take

03:53.620 --> 03:59.080
one hundred viewport with so that basically the whole viewport width regardless of how big the browser

03:59.080 --> 04:07.390
is sized or the device is sized and we just want to take away 90 pixels from it and let's save.

04:07.870 --> 04:14.080
OK so now you can see that these two just ignore this for now but these ones perfectly fit in there

04:14.080 --> 04:21.080
and if I make this smaller they adjust OK so we're just taking the viewport with meaning the whole thing

04:21.100 --> 04:30.790
we're taking away 90 pixels because if we were to do just one hundred viewport width and save you'll

04:30.790 --> 04:33.620
see that it actually goes off the page like that.

04:33.670 --> 04:34.820
That doesn't look right.

04:34.870 --> 04:38.410
So we're just taking 90 pixels away.

04:39.010 --> 04:42.430
Now we want to move these boxes over to the right.

04:42.430 --> 04:46.160
We want these all in line so to do that.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.130
Let's take timeline.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.710
Well Ally we want to grab the ones in the left.

04:50.710 --> 04:57.320
So he's going to do ally and child.

04:57.550 --> 05:06.770
And we want the even divs and going to say from the left 40 pixels and save.

05:07.090 --> 05:08.280
Now we're just about there.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.970
But the arrows on the.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.800
The ones that were on the left the arrows are still facing on the right side.

05:13.840 --> 05:19.620
So we simply need to move them to this side which we can copy.

05:19.690 --> 05:25.750
This whole thing right here the right side arrows because these are pointing this way and paste that

05:25.870 --> 05:29.670
in here and just change this to even and save.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.820
And now they're all facing that way.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.110
All right.

05:32.140 --> 05:34.510
So now it's completely responsive.

05:34.690 --> 05:36.130
Hit nine hundred pixels.

05:36.190 --> 05:40.270
They get smaller gets 600 pixels and they adapt.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.270
They all go to the right side.

05:42.310 --> 05:42.560
All right.

05:42.580 --> 05:47.230
So that's it in the next video we're going to show you how we can implement a little bit of JavaScript

05:47.230 --> 05:50.920
to have a little bit of animation on the scroll.
