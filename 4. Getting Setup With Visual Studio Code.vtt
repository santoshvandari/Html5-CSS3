WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:05.740
All right guys so we're almost ready to start learning how to learn each team LCROSS build Web sites.

00:05.790 --> 00:08.070
But before we do that we need a couple things.

00:08.070 --> 00:12.390
What's good about learning each team on C assesses it doesn't take much to get started.

00:12.420 --> 00:17.640
If you're learning a more complex language like let's say peach PEA or Python or something like that

00:17.880 --> 00:23.040
usually you'll need to install a web server locally so that you can develop on your local machine.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.140
And that takes a lot more work.

00:25.170 --> 00:29.340
Some languages even need to be compiled and you need something called an IDC.

00:29.430 --> 00:34.440
But with each team LCROSS we can simply click on an each team Al file and run it in a browser.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.390
We can also edit it with a text editor.

00:36.390 --> 00:40.410
So those are the two things we need as a browser and a text editor.

00:40.410 --> 00:46.680
Now it doesn't matter what operating system you're on if you're using Windows Mac Linux you can see

00:46.680 --> 00:47.760
I'm on a Mac.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.790
But everything we do in this course.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.840
It doesn't matter what you're on and if there is something little that specific to Windows I will mention

00:54.840 --> 00:57.630
it for you guys that are using Windows.

00:57.630 --> 01:01.920
Now your system comes with a browser and a text editor.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.900
So for windows you have for instance edge and notepad for Mac.

01:06.930 --> 01:12.780
You have safari and text edit but these are not good for web development especially the text editors

01:13.560 --> 01:19.020
for a browser I would definitely recommend Google Chrome it's it's the most popular in the web development

01:19.020 --> 01:19.550
community.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.580
It's very fast.

01:20.580 --> 01:26.150
It's fast to a to adapt new features and CSX javascript and so on.

01:26.340 --> 01:32.880
It also has really great development tools second to to Chrome I would say Firefox as far as a text

01:32.880 --> 01:37.860
editor you don't want to use Notepad or anything like that because there's no features there's no syntax

01:37.860 --> 01:40.530
highlighting anything like that.

01:40.530 --> 01:46.080
There's a lot of choices but what I would recommend and what I'm going to use is visual studio code

01:46.380 --> 01:49.890
and I use this for everything I don't just use it for each team LCROSS.

01:49.890 --> 01:56.640
I also use it for AP HP Javascript Python any language that I work with because it's just very fast

01:56.640 --> 02:03.030
it's intuitive has a lot of features it has great extensions and it's just all around it's just a great

02:03.030 --> 02:03.800
editor.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.620
So that's what we'll be using.

02:05.730 --> 02:10.230
I don't have it installed so I'm going to go ahead and download it and it's available for Windows Mac

02:10.230 --> 02:12.890
or Linux doesn't matter what system you're on.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.730
So on a Mac it's just going to give me the zip file.

02:15.780 --> 02:21.970
I'll go ahead and open it up or unpacking it and you can see I have my icon here and I'm just going

02:21.970 --> 02:24.260
to bring it to my applications folder.

02:24.860 --> 02:27.320
OK so once it's in there I can open it up.

02:27.330 --> 02:31.110
I'm actually going to drag it down to my bar which you guys can't see.

02:31.560 --> 02:36.560
Just so I can easily access it and then I'll go ahead and open it.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.780
So when you first open up this code you'll see a welcome page.

02:39.790 --> 02:45.090
It'll give you some options like open up a file open a folder you'll show your recent projects and the

02:45.090 --> 02:49.010
only reason I have recent projects is because I already had VSO code installed.

02:49.020 --> 02:51.440
I just uninstalled it for this course.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.290
If also over here if you want to change your theme.

02:54.330 --> 02:59.700
So if I click color theme it will open up this which is the command palette and I for instance we could

02:59.700 --> 03:04.770
change it to a light theme and you can kind of experiment with these a little bit.

03:04.770 --> 03:08.110
I'm just gonna keep the regular dark theme like that.

03:08.110 --> 03:12.180
So let's close this welcome page up and head over to the side bar.

03:12.180 --> 03:15.750
So this first icon here is your your file explorer.

03:15.750 --> 03:20.580
So when you have a Web site or a web application it's gonna be in a folder and you're going to want

03:20.580 --> 03:24.800
to open that folder so that you can see the files and access them easily.

03:24.810 --> 03:30.750
So I actually have a folder that is on my desktop that I'm going to open called Split landing page which

03:30.750 --> 03:36.320
is just a very simple web site with some javascript and HDMI LCROSS.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.860
So I'm gonna open that and you'll see that I have the files over here.

03:40.890 --> 03:43.310
So we have one HD him file.

03:43.470 --> 03:49.310
We have a CSX file for styling and then we have a javascript file and when I just click them once I

03:49.340 --> 03:54.300
notice that they just open and they just stay in this one tab and then it kind of closes when I click

03:54.300 --> 03:54.930
on the next one.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.850
If I double click it'll stay.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.720
So if I go click on the next file notice that the.

03:59.790 --> 04:02.160
Each team will index each team l stayed there.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.690
OK if I double click this one it'll stay there and then I can just close them up.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.580
OK and we'll be working in the file explorer quite a bit.

04:09.630 --> 04:12.630
So the next thing I want to show you is the settings.

04:12.630 --> 04:16.890
Now this this text right here is way too small especially for doing a course.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.890
You guys probably can barely read this.

04:18.930 --> 04:24.870
So to get to the settings you can go to this little gear and you can go to settings or you can do control

04:24.930 --> 04:31.080
karma on an on a Windows machine or command karma on a Mac and that will also bring you to the settings

04:31.140 --> 04:32.400
as we go along here.

04:32.400 --> 04:38.340
I'm going to be teaching you guys some of the keyboard shortcuts because e your your workflow really

04:38.340 --> 04:44.910
speeds up when you learn shortcuts and when we write our code our each team LCROSS I'm going to teach

04:44.910 --> 04:49.350
you some shortcuts to navigate around really easily as well.

04:49.350 --> 04:54.960
So what I want to change is the font size which is actually right here Ed font size but if I couldn't

04:54.960 --> 05:00.150
find this I could just search for it up here so I could say font size and you can see now it's at the

05:00.150 --> 05:04.110
top here it's 14 pixels by default.

05:04.110 --> 05:08.570
So I want to change it to twenty six and that should take effect right away.

05:08.580 --> 05:11.730
The only other setting I want to change is my tab space.

05:11.730 --> 05:18.350
So if I type in tab spaces the default is for and what this means is the number of spaces that it indents

05:18.360 --> 05:19.860
when you hit tab.

05:19.860 --> 05:20.220
OK.

05:20.220 --> 05:26.610
Because in each team L and in most languages you're going to have you're going to indent to organize

05:26.610 --> 05:30.990
your code but for is a little too much for me I like to keep it at two.

05:31.230 --> 05:34.710
So going to change that to two and that should save right away.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.530
So let's close up the settings and now if I go back to let's say index each team l notice the font is

05:40.530 --> 05:41.530
much bigger.

05:41.580 --> 05:42.020
OK.

05:42.030 --> 05:46.260
And a tab now is two spaces as opposed to four.

05:46.290 --> 05:50.040
So the last thing I want to do is just go over these other icons.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.900
This one is just to search if you want to search within the page you can also replace.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.450
This is for version control with a get.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.350
We're not going to get into that right now.

05:59.370 --> 06:04.710
This is a debugger for programming languages like Python javascript and so on.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.520
Also something we're not going to get into.

06:06.630 --> 06:12.060
But this one right here the last one is your extensions K so you can extend the functionality of V.S.

06:12.060 --> 06:18.150
code with a whole bunch of extensions and we don't have any installed right now but it does show some

06:18.150 --> 06:22.780
of the popular ones shows us some of the recommended recommendations.

06:22.920 --> 06:29.580
If you want to search you can search like let's say we're using P HP if we want to search for p p extensions

06:29.940 --> 06:35.430
like this one right here and tell essence and if we click on that it'll show us a bunch of documentation

06:35.430 --> 06:36.550
and examples.

06:36.570 --> 06:42.360
Basically this gives you some p p drop downs as you can see right here if we wanted to install this

06:42.360 --> 06:46.650
we could just click the green install button and it would simply get installed.

06:46.650 --> 06:51.960
And if I make this a little bigger you can see the number of downloads you can see this one has five

06:51.960 --> 06:55.890
point seven million downloads and a rating of three point five.

06:55.930 --> 06:58.940
Case you see the number of downloads as well as the ratings.

06:59.010 --> 07:04.080
And I do have a couple extensions that I want to install later but I don't want to get into that right

07:04.080 --> 07:05.060
now.

07:05.070 --> 07:05.400
All right.

07:05.400 --> 07:10.230
So now that you have these codes set up in the next section we're going to jump in and we're going to

07:10.230 --> 07:11.620
start to learn HDL.
