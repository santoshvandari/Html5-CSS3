All right guys so in this video I want to show you how to install something called live server which

00:05.310 --> 00:07.450
is something we'll be using through the course.

00:07.530 --> 00:13.470
And basically it's an extension to V.S. code that allow us to open our aged e-mail pages on a little

00:13.470 --> 00:17.040
development server as opposed to open them in the file system.

00:17.040 --> 00:22.590
So right now you can see that the website is open and if you look at the you are Albar it's file colon

00:22.890 --> 00:27.290
with three slashes and then basically just shows the path to the file.

00:27.510 --> 00:33.660
So the server will actually open it on what's called our local host and not only that it will or it

00:33.660 --> 00:34.920
will auto reload.

00:34.920 --> 00:41.220
So when we save in each team I'll file or CSX or JavaScript or anything else it's going to just auto

00:41.220 --> 00:41.760
reload.

00:41.770 --> 00:45.760
You don't have to keep hitting the reload button every time we make a change.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.720
So we're gonna go ahead and do that and I'm gonna just create a new file here.

00:50.820 --> 00:57.570
I'm going to call it 0 2 underscore Liv underscore server dot age to email just naming it after what

00:57.570 --> 00:58.440
we're doing here.

00:58.680 --> 01:04.050
And there's something else that I want to show you guys instead of typing out the whole structure here

01:04.050 --> 01:09.930
like we did in this file with this code we can use Emmett's to generate that structure.

01:09.930 --> 01:15.810
So what I'm going to do is just put an exclamation and I can either hit enter or tab and it's just going

01:15.810 --> 01:22.190
to kind of create that structure for us so we don't have to type it out for every age HTML page we create.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.570
Now notice there are some some added things here we have some meta tags we're going gonna go over meta

01:27.570 --> 01:30.180
tags including these ones in the next video.

01:30.840 --> 01:36.240
But for now I just wanted to show you that we can quickly generate our structure our our doc type each

01:36.240 --> 01:38.460
team all had body tags and stuff like that.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.060
So we're going to change the title here to live server and we'll go down here and just put an H1 and

01:45.060 --> 01:47.940
we'll say we'll say hello world does it really matter.

01:47.950 --> 01:54.020
I just want to put something and then I'm gonna save this with control s and we want to now install

01:54.030 --> 02:00.480
Live servers somewhere and go over here to this extensions icon and make this a little bigger and we're

02:00.480 --> 02:07.410
going to search for live dash server and it's gonna be this this one here this first one with this purple

02:07.410 --> 02:08.490
icon.

02:08.490 --> 02:13.560
Now to install an extension and V.S. code you just want to click the little green install button once

02:13.560 --> 02:16.320
it installs you want to click reload to activate.

02:16.350 --> 02:22.440
So it's just going to kind of reset the EDI editor and now under enabled you're going to see live server

02:22.530 --> 02:28.170
and any other extensions that you install will also be displayed here.

02:28.170 --> 02:35.100
So now what we can do is instead of leaving and going and opening up the file we can simply right click

02:35.160 --> 02:41.460
and we can say open with live server and the browser will automatically open and it will display the

02:41.460 --> 02:43.950
web page and notice that you are all now is different.

02:43.950 --> 02:46.080
It's not just that file path.

02:46.080 --> 02:52.680
It's 1 2 7 0 0 1 which is what's called the loop back address and this is always going to loop back

02:52.680 --> 02:54.210
to your local machine.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.000
So this is your local host.

02:56.130 --> 03:00.720
And then this colon 50 500 this is the port number that it's running on.

03:00.750 --> 03:05.600
You can run things on different ports and then you just have the name of the file that's loading.

03:05.610 --> 03:11.280
So from now on we're going to use live server to open our files instead of you know leaving and going

03:11.280 --> 03:13.900
and opening the file manually.

03:13.950 --> 03:20.970
Also if I change something like let's change this to we'll just add a paragraph here and we'll say this

03:21.030 --> 03:27.170
is a test and I'll just save and now if I go to Chrome you can see this is a test is displayed.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.800
I didn't have to go and reload it.

03:28.830 --> 03:34.650
It just auto loads and this is great for when you when you actually have you know your editor on one

03:34.650 --> 03:38.310
side and then the browser because it automatically updates.

03:38.340 --> 03:42.480
Now I don't want to do that because I only have so much screen real estate here for you guys and I don't

03:42.480 --> 03:44.610
want to make that the editor too small.

03:44.850 --> 03:50.220
We might do that in some videos later on but for now I'm just going to switch back and forth.

03:50.580 --> 03:56.090
So to stop the server if you go down here you can see this port fifty five hundred.

03:56.130 --> 03:58.980
If you click that it will stop the server from running.

03:59.250 --> 04:04.620
And if I go back to the browser and reload you'll see it and it no longer works if I want to start it

04:04.620 --> 04:11.190
again I can either again do open with live server or I can click this go live link down here if I click

04:11.190 --> 04:15.380
that it will start it back up and open it in the browser.

04:15.390 --> 04:15.710
All right.

04:15.720 --> 04:21.270
So I just wanted to show you guys that and let you know that that's what we'll be using as opposed to

04:21.270 --> 04:25.280
just opening the opening our HD him all files right on the file system.

04:25.320 --> 04:29.970
So in the next video we're going to take a look at meta tags we'll look at the ones that are generated

04:29.970 --> 04:31.590
here as well as some others.
