00:00.530 --> 00:03.760
All right guys in this video we're going to take a look at lists and tables.

00:03.780 --> 00:11.020
So let's create a new file and we're going to call it 0 6 underscore lists underscore tables dot each

00:11.030 --> 00:15.180
team out and add in our boilerplate here.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.650
Close that up lists and tables.

00:20.110 --> 00:23.010
OK so we have a couple of different types of lists.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.320
So we have unordered lists

00:28.440 --> 00:29.880
and unordered lists.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.560
They're not numbered and basically they're they have bullet points which of course you can remove with

00:34.560 --> 00:35.220
CSX.

00:35.220 --> 00:38.100
You can you can have different types of bullet points.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.200
But let's go out and create an unordered list.

00:40.200 --> 00:47.280
So we want to put a U L tag and then each item in the list should be wrapped in a list item in ally

00:47.310 --> 00:48.070
tag.

00:48.090 --> 00:54.830
So let's go ahead and just say item 1 and what I'll do is I'll hold down shift in option or shift in

00:54.880 --> 01:01.530
Ault and just hit the down arrow so that we can bring these down and let's change that to three and

01:01.530 --> 01:04.120
four and we'll save this control less.

01:04.140 --> 01:10.890
And then let's open this with live server and there we go so that's what it's going to give us.

01:10.890 --> 01:16.740
I'm actually going to zoom in a little bit on the H terminal so you can see this better should probably

01:16.870 --> 01:20.000
get a while ago and notice that the bullets are here.

01:20.010 --> 01:24.420
And like I said these can be removed through CSX.

01:24.420 --> 01:28.610
We can also have different types of bullets.

01:28.650 --> 01:36.030
This isn't something that I would recommend but you can use a style tag to change the attributes and

01:36.060 --> 01:39.030
there is something called a list style.

01:39.030 --> 01:42.450
And we have circle square.

01:42.450 --> 01:46.240
Let's see let's change it to a square and save.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.720
Now you can see that each bullet is a square.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.020
We have desk save that.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.390
That's the default circle.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.180
Save that.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.860
So that's kind of an unfilled circle.

02:01.190 --> 02:03.800
And then we also have actually I think that's it.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.170
And then we have none.

02:06.170 --> 02:06.500
All right.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.670
And I add this is something that I would not recommend doing you want to.

02:09.740 --> 02:13.080
You want to put all your styling in your CSF style sheet.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.090
But I just wanted to give you an example of this.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.540
So let's get rid of that.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.950
So that's an unordered list.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.180
At the same time we have ordered lists

02:26.290 --> 02:28.640
and I'm going to give you another little Emmett trick here.

02:28.640 --> 02:33.620
So first of all it's an O L tag and then we still use allies.

02:33.620 --> 02:33.920
OK.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.180
We still use list items whether it's ordered or unordered.

02:37.250 --> 02:43.910
Now with Emmett let's say I want to have four list items I can actually do time so I can put an asterisk

02:44.240 --> 02:48.440
for and hit tab and it'll actually give me four or list items.

02:48.440 --> 02:52.800
Case a little tip there and we can fill these in.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.910
Let's say item 1 item 2

03:00.270 --> 03:01.420
item 4.

03:01.530 --> 03:02.580
And we'll save that.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.600
And now notice that instead of bullets we actually have numbers.

03:06.680 --> 03:06.920
OK.

03:06.930 --> 03:08.920
So it's a number list.

03:09.570 --> 03:13.830
And then we can change the type as well.

03:13.830 --> 03:15.810
So there's a type attribute.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.960
So basically Type 1 is the default if I save that you'll see no change.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.570
That's just numbers.

03:24.570 --> 03:31.500
I am we can use type uppercase a if I save that it'll change it to uppercase letters.

03:31.500 --> 03:38.190
If we use lowercase a is the type it'll be lowercase letters we can use uppercase I which will actually

03:38.190 --> 03:43.950
do uppercase Roman numerals lowercase i will do lowercase Roman numerals.

03:43.950 --> 03:49.350
So just to let you know that you can add the type attribute ordered list is something that I almost

03:49.350 --> 03:54.180
never use unordered list is something you're going to use all the time because they're used for navigation

03:54.180 --> 04:01.550
menus whether it's a horizontal navigate nav bar or if it's a side menu or anything like that.

04:01.740 --> 04:05.740
So we can also have nested lists.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.720
So let's actually copy this.

04:08.710 --> 04:16.380
So I'm going to just control C copy this well here and control V will paste that in and let's say we

04:16.380 --> 04:18.360
want to have a list within the list.

04:18.420 --> 04:23.920
So inside this ally the second one let's get rid of that.

04:24.120 --> 04:30.610
Actually we'll keep that but next to it I'm going to go on a new line and I'm going to put another well

04:30.720 --> 04:41.290
inside here and let's put a ally and we'll say nested item one OK and then we'll do nested item two.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.560
Let's save that.

04:42.660 --> 04:46.050
And now you can see that these two items are nested in the act.

04:46.050 --> 04:51.840
It automatically changes the the bullet point here to a circle.

04:51.870 --> 04:54.290
Changes it from a disk to a circle.

04:54.330 --> 04:58.780
So lists are pretty simple styling them as is a whole new level.

04:58.830 --> 05:03.960
When you start to get into creating navigation bars and stuff like that but we'll get into that later

05:03.960 --> 05:06.870
on when we start to deal with CSX.

05:06.870 --> 05:07.130
All right.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.820
So let's talk about tables OK.

05:09.830 --> 05:13.620
So tables are used for tabular data.

05:13.620 --> 05:21.260
Now back in the day back in you know eight nine ten years ago people would actually use tables to for

05:21.260 --> 05:22.430
a Web site layout.

05:22.440 --> 05:30.270
Before we had proper CSX before we had flex box in the grid system and and frameworks and stuff like

05:30.270 --> 05:36.660
that people would actually would have like their sidebar and their main content area in their Web site

05:36.690 --> 05:40.680
be a table which is absolutely horrible you never want to do anything like that.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.800
You only want to use tables for tabular data.

05:44.190 --> 05:52.310
If you have a you know list of users or whatever it may be just some kind of data.

05:52.380 --> 06:02.400
So to create a table we want to put a table tag and in a table we have a head a body and we can also

06:02.400 --> 06:04.110
have a footer If we want.

06:04.110 --> 06:13.410
I don't usually use photos but for the head we're gonna say T had OK and we want a table row inside

06:13.410 --> 06:21.180
the table row we want some columns but when it's with when it's a heading you want to use t h k for

06:21.180 --> 06:28.110
table head and let's do first name and then we'll bring this down twice by holding control option or

06:28.110 --> 06:39.850
control alt and hit the down arrow twice and we'll change this to let's say last name and let's do email.

06:39.870 --> 06:40.160
OK.

06:40.170 --> 06:43.700
Now if I save this you'll see that these are our headings.

06:43.800 --> 06:49.590
OK so these are the headings and then we want the data underneath so the data is going to go in the

06:49.590 --> 06:50.430
T body.

06:52.370 --> 06:52.670
OK.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.760
So we have our table our table head and then our table body which you also have table rows.

06:58.860 --> 07:08.850
But instead of T.H. We want to use t d gave t h is only for the heading and then we'll say to John bring

07:08.850 --> 07:10.980
down two more.

07:10.980 --> 07:14.610
So DOE would be the last name and email

07:17.620 --> 07:19.740
OK if I save that.

07:20.090 --> 07:26.600
And there we go so we have first name we have one entry here or one row with it which is John Doe and

07:26.600 --> 07:28.030
then his email.

07:28.130 --> 07:33.440
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy this whole table row and let's do two more

07:36.180 --> 07:37.670
I want to fix this up a little bit

07:45.150 --> 07:50.060
and we'll go ahead and change up some of this data.

07:50.090 --> 07:55.130
So say Kate Smith.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.690
Kate you have

08:03.940 --> 08:04.200
all right.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.560
So we'll save that.

08:05.690 --> 08:09.720
And now we have three rows in our table.

08:09.770 --> 08:16.310
OK so pretty simple if we want to we could change the width.

08:16.470 --> 08:22.500
Now I would suggest doing this stuff through CSX but just to show you we can we can use this style attribute

08:22.890 --> 08:33.710
and we can say with I don't know six hundred pixels and now it's wider and it just it's more readable

08:33.860 --> 08:34.460
like that.

08:35.090 --> 08:40.820
But again I would suggest not using the style attribute that's not good practice but we haven't gotten

08:40.820 --> 08:41.930
into CSX yet.

08:42.170 --> 08:46.250
So in the next video we're going to take a look at forms and input fields.
