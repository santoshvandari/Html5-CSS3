00:00.370 --> 00:00.900
All right guys.

00:00.900 --> 00:07.770
Now we're going to look at transitions which are similar to how key frame animations work except transitions

00:07.770 --> 00:09.930
happen basically on an event.

00:09.930 --> 00:17.280
So if you hover over something that's a good example you would have a transition with with a property

00:17.310 --> 00:18.830
that is animator bold.

00:18.840 --> 00:24.240
So like the with the color basically anything that we can do with the key frame animations.

00:24.240 --> 00:34.080
So let's create a new file here called 0 9 underscore transitions dot HDMI all OK and we'll put in our

00:34.080 --> 00:39.360
boiler plate here.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.090
Close that up.

00:41.110 --> 00:48.000
Let's put our style and for the body again I'm just going to have a class A BOX.

00:48.040 --> 00:48.260
OK.

00:48.270 --> 00:51.720
We're going to use this element to display transitions.

00:51.720 --> 00:58.540
Now I'm going to add some other styling as well so for the body I'm going to do background three three

00:58.600 --> 00:59.910
three just like we did before.

00:59.910 --> 01:05.510
I'm also going to display it as a flex because the item I want to put it directly in the middle.

01:05.640 --> 01:14.520
So I think this is one of the easiest ways to do that is just displaying as flex doing a line items

01:15.360 --> 01:21.900
center justify content center and then we need a height on it.

01:21.930 --> 01:25.930
So we'll say one hundred viewport heights.

01:25.980 --> 01:26.280
All right.

01:26.310 --> 01:31.620
So let's open this with life server actually opened in the wrong browser.

01:31.620 --> 01:32.640
Let me bring it over.

01:33.300 --> 01:33.530
OK.

01:33.570 --> 01:38.790
So we just have a dark background now let's add the style for the box.

01:38.790 --> 01:49.320
So I'm going to do background whites we'll use color names and let's do a width of one hundred pixels

01:49.440 --> 01:52.590
and a height of one hundred pixels.

01:52.590 --> 01:56.060
So this should give us a square right in the middle of the page.

01:56.160 --> 01:56.500
All right.

01:56.520 --> 02:04.590
Now we're gonna take a look first at the different transition properties and then we'll look at compacting

02:04.590 --> 02:10.620
it into the single transition property just like with with the animation you have a bunch of different

02:10.620 --> 02:15.270
properties and you can combine them just like background properties all that stuff.

02:15.290 --> 02:18.490
Borders this does a shorthand way for just about everything.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.300
Margin padding.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.980
So let's first look at the.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.750
It's actually called Transition property.

02:26.790 --> 02:27.130
OK.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.850
So you're going to say transition dash property.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.540
And here's where we specify which properties we actually want to have a transition on a hover or something

02:39.540 --> 02:40.080
like that.

02:40.110 --> 02:47.790
So we could do all or we could specify a specific property so I'm going to start off with just a specific

02:47.790 --> 02:49.910
property of background.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.690
So that's the property that I want to add a transition to.

02:54.690 --> 03:01.470
And then let's add a transition dash duration.

03:01.470 --> 03:06.210
So this would be in seconds let's say we'll say two seconds.

03:06.290 --> 03:07.080
OK.

03:07.110 --> 03:12.630
Now if I save that nothing happens because the way that this works is like I said it has to be on some

03:12.630 --> 03:13.410
kind of event.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.120
So we're going to add a hover.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.290
So it's a box hover.

03:19.290 --> 03:23.420
And I'm just going to set the background to read.

03:24.170 --> 03:24.510
OK.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.410
That's it.

03:25.410 --> 03:30.260
Now if I save this and I hover over it let me just show you without the transition first.

03:30.250 --> 03:33.450
If we get rid of that and I hover over it it just it just goes to red.

03:33.480 --> 03:33.780
Right.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.550
We've seen this before.

03:35.580 --> 03:40.490
If I use it transition it slowly transitions into red.

03:40.500 --> 03:47.470
And then when I come off it it transitions back to white guy in the in the duration of two seconds.

03:47.620 --> 03:53.740
So you can just use the sign simple button hovers maybe put like one second on the button hover and

03:53.740 --> 03:59.140
it just gives it a smoother effect rather than just you know shifting right to red.

03:59.140 --> 04:01.410
Now we can also add delays if we want.

04:01.440 --> 04:07.570
So we could say transition dash delay say one second.

04:08.120 --> 04:12.260
And now if I if I hover over it nothing's going to happen for one second.

04:12.340 --> 04:17.320
Actually that wasn't really noticeable let's do three seconds and I'm hovering over it.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.280
And after three seconds it starts.

04:20.320 --> 04:20.700
OK.

04:20.710 --> 04:22.210
So that's the transition delay.

04:22.510 --> 04:24.160
We also have the timing function.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.270
I'm going to put that right here.

04:26.290 --> 04:30.730
Transition dash timing function.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.730
And this we're going to use ease in out.

04:33.730 --> 04:33.960
OK.

04:33.970 --> 04:42.500
So basically just like with the key frames and let's comment out the delay and just ease in and out.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.890
So it starts off slow and ends slow.

04:46.900 --> 04:54.310
Now of course you can take all of this and put this all together in just the transition property.

04:54.450 --> 05:03.850
We can say background then we can do it the duration which we'll say two seconds and the timing function

05:03.880 --> 05:05.400
ease in out.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.800
And if we wanted to delay we could add that on here as well.

05:08.800 --> 05:16.150
But I don't want to delay so doing this we should be able to comment all this stuff though because it

05:16.150 --> 05:17.580
does the same exact thing.

05:17.590 --> 05:20.500
So we'll save and then we go.

05:21.040 --> 05:21.370
OK.

05:21.370 --> 05:25.770
Now there's other other things that we can add that we can transition.

05:25.780 --> 05:35.090
So let's let's go ahead and say border dash radius and we'll set that to 50 percent.

05:35.170 --> 05:36.490
Now if I hover over it.

05:36.490 --> 05:44.890
Notice that the transition is only working on the color background color the border radius is just switching

05:45.130 --> 05:45.700
right away.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.790
That's because we didn't specify that here.

05:48.790 --> 05:54.850
Now what I could do is I could add a comma and I could say we also want to transition border radius

05:56.590 --> 05:57.190
that

06:01.050 --> 06:05.250
and now you can see that it transitions.

06:05.250 --> 06:10.590
But what I would probably do here is in all unless there was something you didn't want to transition

06:10.590 --> 06:14.820
for some reason but I want everything here to transition.

06:14.820 --> 06:18.510
So that works the same way we get a cool little effect.

06:18.660 --> 06:23.350
Now we can also do like the height and the width so let's say we want to make it bigger we'll say 300

06:23.370 --> 06:30.510
pixels and say with 300 pixels and save.

06:30.540 --> 06:38.730
And now it goes from a little white school square to a big red circle on hover and it does it very very

06:38.730 --> 06:41.220
smoothly all right.

06:41.730 --> 06:44.000
And again just experiment with it.

06:44.010 --> 06:49.830
There's no use some other properties in fact all the transitional properties I'm actually going to paste

06:49.830 --> 06:51.110
in this file for you guys.

06:51.120 --> 06:51.840
So you have it.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.190
So I'm going to go right here and paste this in.

06:55.410 --> 07:02.520
So transitional properties they have to have an identifiable identifiable and identifiable halfway point.

07:02.520 --> 07:15.600
So things like colors positions with font weight font size max height Max with opacity outline color

07:15.630 --> 07:21.840
visibility with word spacing z index all these things can be different values it can have a halfway

07:21.840 --> 07:22.250
point.

07:22.260 --> 07:26.630
It's not just like it's not binary it's not one or the other.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.030
All right.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.260
So these are all the properties that you can experiment with.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.400
So I'll save that.

07:31.410 --> 07:35.020
And you guys will have that for for reference.

07:35.250 --> 07:40.500
So in the next video I want to look at the transform property which you can use in conjunction with

07:40.590 --> 07:48.150
transitions to do some really cool stuff as far as rotating and moving things around the page things

07:48.150 --> 07:48.960
like that.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.170
All right.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.120
So we'll take a look at transform next.
