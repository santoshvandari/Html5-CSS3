WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:01.110
All right guys.

00:01.110 --> 00:07.920
Now we're gonna start to work on the basically smartphone version of the of the website.

00:07.920 --> 00:12.630
So let's start off with the nav bar because that doesn't look too good.

00:12.630 --> 00:20.040
So in our mobile dot CSX I'm going to add a media query so this is for smart phones.

00:20.370 --> 00:28.980
So let's say at media and we'll say max width of 500 pixels

00:32.010 --> 00:34.290
and let's see.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.870
So we're gonna target the nav bar first right.

00:36.900 --> 00:44.220
So it has an idea of nav bar and I'm going to change I'm going to actually keep the Flex but I'm going

00:44.220 --> 00:49.120
to change the direction because we have it as a row which is horizontal.

00:49.110 --> 00:52.470
Let's change it to column once I save that.

00:52.470 --> 00:57.540
Now you can see that it's going this way instead of horizontal.

00:57.690 --> 01:05.260
And I'm also going to add the A line dash items to the center and save.

01:05.460 --> 01:08.490
And it already starts to look pretty good.

01:08.490 --> 01:13.050
Now the logo I'm going to add some margin bottom I'm also going to make sure I text align it to the

01:13.050 --> 01:13.500
center.

01:13.500 --> 01:25.080
So let's say nav bar let's target the logo and let's do margin bottom and we're gonna do zero point

01:25.080 --> 01:37.490
five REM and let's do text align center and save that did that push it down.

01:37.510 --> 01:38.070
Yeah I did.

01:38.070 --> 01:38.570
Right.

01:42.700 --> 01:42.990
Let's.

01:43.080 --> 01:48.240
Let's move it a little more so we'll do 7 5.

01:48.430 --> 01:54.060
Actually it doesn't seem to be moving does it.

01:54.230 --> 01:54.970
Logo

02:01.490 --> 02:04.090
display none.

02:04.220 --> 02:09.790
So we are targeting it.

02:09.850 --> 02:10.180
OK.

02:10.180 --> 02:12.740
So I guess we'll just move it down a little more.

02:12.980 --> 02:16.180
Let's do one run OK

02:19.490 --> 02:23.500
so let's see for the well

02:26.710 --> 02:32.400
padding actually the Well I think is let's say we had some padding to it.

02:32.410 --> 02:33.820
So I would now bar.

02:34.210 --> 02:34.690
Well

02:37.150 --> 02:38.440
padding.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.880
Zero point five Ram.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.080
Oh that's why I had it.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.730
Because of that padding so let's change this back to zero point five.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.120
Here we go.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.580
OK.

02:51.610 --> 02:52.300
Next thing

02:55.710 --> 03:00.300
if we go down here notice that we now have this space.

03:00.300 --> 03:08.010
That's because the nav bar the height has now grown in what we had before in our style sheet.

03:08.010 --> 03:13.140
If we look at the showcase let's go up to showcase content.

03:13.140 --> 03:18.540
We had top sixty five because that that basically made up for the now bar.

03:18.570 --> 03:21.570
But now the now bar is bigger.

03:21.750 --> 03:37.650
So let's do we're gonna go and say showcase content that's prefixes with I.D. showcase

03:39.830 --> 03:46.130
and instead of sixty five let's say top 110 10 pixels and save.

03:46.130 --> 03:49.600
And now if we go down you can see that there is no more space here.

03:49.610 --> 03:50.870
So that covers it.

03:50.930 --> 03:55.820
And if we make this bigger into the regular size it's fine.

03:55.820 --> 04:03.640
So as soon as we hit 500 pixels it goes into this this menu here.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.010
All right.

04:04.010 --> 04:09.090
So let's see what else what else we have to do here.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.610
So that looks good.

04:13.310 --> 04:18.060
And we'll tell we'll test the devices after this here this this who area.

04:18.070 --> 04:25.280
I want to get rid of the image and actually we're going to remove the Flex from the WHO I.D. because

04:25.280 --> 04:30.620
right now this is a flex box and these two are flex items since we're are removing the this image here.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.600
There's no need for flex.

04:32.600 --> 04:45.230
So let's say who and we'll say display block and if I save that the image is going to go away because

04:45.230 --> 04:51.950
now since the image is in part of a flex box it would need a height to display.

04:51.950 --> 04:56.700
But I don't even want to display it at all so I'm just going to say who.

04:56.720 --> 05:03.230
And then we're going to take the class of who Dash I am G which the image is wrapped in and we're simply

05:03.230 --> 05:07.930
going to say display none OK so we'll save that.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.440
All right so looks pretty good.

05:10.450 --> 05:13.700
Next thing is the clients.

05:13.810 --> 05:18.030
So I mean we could leave it like this but the images are really small.

05:18.100 --> 05:28.540
So what I'd like to do is first of all increase the with so many say clients dot items and grab the

05:28.540 --> 05:29.880
images themselves.

05:29.890 --> 05:33.500
And we have 60 percent by default in style CSF.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.800
Let's change it to 80 and save it.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.800
But I want to remove the last one.

05:39.820 --> 05:50.280
So what we can do is say client's items and grab the div but we want the last child we're going to use

05:50.280 --> 05:57.560
the pseudo selector last child and say display display none.

05:57.620 --> 06:03.650
So if you watch the last logo when I save this it goes away and I think that looks a little better.

06:03.650 --> 06:09.320
They're bigger and there's less of them and we didn't even have to mess with the markup to get rid of

06:09.320 --> 06:11.400
the logo.

06:11.510 --> 06:13.460
Let's see now the contact.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.680
We also want to remove the flax because we want these to stack.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.170
We don't want them to align.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.920
So let's say contact

06:25.190 --> 06:28.100
and actually know we could try.

06:28.100 --> 06:36.440
I did when I initially did this I did display block but let's try flex direction and let's do column

06:36.470 --> 06:39.050
instead and see what that looks like.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.210
OK.

06:40.460 --> 06:46.610
Now the reason we can't see the map anymore is because since it's no longer basically attached to the

06:46.610 --> 06:50.060
form horizontally we need to add a height.

06:50.060 --> 07:00.150
So let's say contact map excuse me and let's say height 200 pixels and save.

07:00.180 --> 07:05.600
Now if we go down we can see the map and I also want to just have a little boy like a black border right

07:05.600 --> 07:06.310
here.

07:06.350 --> 07:13.970
So on the map let's say border top and you can see you can style it however you want on different screens.

07:13.970 --> 07:19.910
I'm gonna do four pixels solid and three three three save.

07:19.910 --> 07:23.620
And now we have square is it pixels light.

07:23.700 --> 07:29.990
P.S. And now we have this border right here which is pretty cool so let's you know.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.990
So once we hit 500 it turns into that

07:37.410 --> 07:40.400
all right good.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.630
Let's see

07:44.000 --> 07:50.960
now the showcase content looks good in a browser but let's actually do the real test and look at it

07:51.680 --> 07:52.540
on the device.

07:52.550 --> 07:58.100
So we're going to open up our chrome tools and check out the device.

07:58.360 --> 08:03.980
OK so this is an iPhone X and I think that looks pretty good.

08:04.030 --> 08:04.280
Yeah.

08:04.310 --> 08:13.880
Everything seems cool so let's check the iPhone 6 7 8 plus.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.710
Good try.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.400
Six seven eight.

08:19.430 --> 08:19.880
Good

08:24.010 --> 08:25.100
and see.

08:25.100 --> 08:35.560
Galaxy Well we could we could move the showcase content up a little bit yeah.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.480
Why don't we do that.

08:36.480 --> 08:40.290
So let's see do we have a showcase content here.

08:40.290 --> 08:40.950
No.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.490
Yeah right here.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.480
So showcase content.

08:45.480 --> 08:49.350
We did top one hundred ten pixels.

08:50.070 --> 08:54.650
Let's do a margin dash top.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.730
But let's do a negative value in this.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.770
What this will do is it will suck the content up.

08:59.820 --> 09:07.980
So notice that right now on the galaxy the read more is kind of it's not in the in the you know the

09:07.980 --> 09:09.570
viewport when you first enter.

09:09.570 --> 09:11.780
I mean you can simply scroll down and it's fine.

09:11.790 --> 09:14.610
But I'd like to just move this up a little bit.

09:15.090 --> 09:15.780
So I'm going to do.

09:15.780 --> 09:16.790
Negative.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.880
It's too negative to REM and save.

09:20.880 --> 09:26.490
And now this is actually in the you know above the fold is what they say.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.210
And then even if we go on like an iPhone X it's still fine it's just up a little more that looks good.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.580
And let's try the iPhone 5.

09:37.930 --> 09:38.210
OK.

09:38.260 --> 09:45.280
So if we wanted to look good on the iPhone 5 which has a very short height what we could do is lessen

09:45.280 --> 09:48.320
the font size of the L heading.

09:49.870 --> 09:51.210
But I'm only going to you know what.

09:51.210 --> 09:57.890
I'm only going to do that if the height is five 68 or less.

09:58.090 --> 09:58.360
Right.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.240
Because this is a height of five sixty eight.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.890
The iPhone 5 the six is six sixty seven.

10:02.890 --> 10:06.090
Everything else is larger than that.

10:06.100 --> 10:18.200
So what I'll do is I'll put an extra media query down here and I'm going to say Max height of five 68

10:18.290 --> 10:19.270
pixels.

10:21.430 --> 10:24.520
And let's take the showcase

10:26.960 --> 10:31.160
actually let me see that again.

10:31.180 --> 10:34.060
No actually we don't need to do the showcase content.

10:34.060 --> 10:34.720
That's fine.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.130
Let's take the L heading

10:39.780 --> 10:42.720
and the original font size I believe is for REM.

10:42.720 --> 10:52.440
So let's say font size and let's set it to three REM and let's take the lead the paragraph has a class

10:52.440 --> 10:53.740
of lead.

10:53.820 --> 11:00.690
We're gonna change that font size to one room which I believe is one point five by default.

11:00.690 --> 11:02.840
And there we go it fits.

11:02.970 --> 11:08.280
So we're targeting 568 height or smaller and then we're at work lessening the font size.

11:08.310 --> 11:14.190
But if we go back to like the iPhone X then the font size is normal.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.810
Actually we have this here though

11:19.070 --> 11:19.770
why is that

11:25.990 --> 11:28.290
that shouldn't be there.

11:28.290 --> 11:34.160
Because we put the top one hundred ten pixels.

11:34.590 --> 11:37.800
Oh is it because of the margin type let me get rid of that.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.140
Yes it is.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.090
It's because.

11:42.090 --> 11:42.390
OK.

11:42.420 --> 11:53.090
So you know what we'll do is we'll only do the margin top negative on heights that are 568 or less.

11:53.430 --> 11:59.670
So showcase content paste that in.

11:59.670 --> 11:59.990
OK.

12:00.030 --> 12:00.960
So that looks good.

12:00.960 --> 12:06.500
Let's go back to the iPhone 5.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.700
Well I guess we still have that problem.

12:08.750 --> 12:17.020
So we have to do is add to the top value.

12:17.030 --> 12:20.850
So we have top one hundred ten.

12:21.590 --> 12:26.780
So let's do top let's try 130 in

12:34.770 --> 12:36.380
showcase.

12:36.650 --> 12:44.070
That could be why I actually wanted to 130 doesn't seem to be enough let's do one 40.

12:44.090 --> 12:48.140
There we go.

12:48.440 --> 12:53.420
OK so the I mean the iPhone 5 isn't really important at least for me.

12:53.430 --> 12:57.530
But I mean it's good to at least have a look decent on older devices.

12:58.420 --> 12:58.720
OK.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.710
So that's going to be it for this project guys.

13:00.750 --> 13:04.120
Hopefully you enjoyed it and you learned quite a bit from it.

13:04.240 --> 13:11.430
If you run into any little bugs or or you know things that aren't displaying quite right on certain

13:11.440 --> 13:17.890
devices maybe you have some some different kind of Android phone and something doesn't look right then

13:17.890 --> 13:23.900
feel free to just tweak it you know go in change some of the values of some of the properties.

13:24.280 --> 13:30.640
I mean this had this Web site obviously isn't like a production Web site that's been fully tested and

13:30.940 --> 13:36.160
and up and running for a while this is something I built for the core so you might run into a couple

13:36.190 --> 13:40.090
things here and they are not just with this project but with any of the projects.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.110
But yeah that's it.

13:41.110 --> 13:46.090
I mean you can use this Web site as kind of a boilerplate or a template for other sites you've just

13:46.090 --> 13:51.250
changed the background image change the colors all that stuff but that's going to be it guys in the

13:51.250 --> 13:52.800
next section.

13:52.870 --> 13:57.460
What I want to do is start to look at Web site deployment because up to this point we've only been building

13:57.460 --> 13:58.860
on our local machine.

13:58.960 --> 14:06.910
So I want to show you how to in probably the simplest way possible to upload a Web site to a shared

14:06.910 --> 14:07.750
hosting account.
