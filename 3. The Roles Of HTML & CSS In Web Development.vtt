WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:06.370
All right guys so web development involves many different technologies including HDMI LCROSS programming

00:06.370 --> 00:09.290
languages frameworks tools and much more.

00:09.370 --> 00:14.110
But each team on CSX or what I call the building blocks this is where you're going to start whether

00:14.110 --> 00:20.140
you want to build just simple five page Web sites or large social networks and online stores.

00:20.140 --> 00:25.570
So I want to talk about the different roles of each team L and CSX how they play into web development.

00:26.110 --> 00:32.110
So each team L is actually short for hypertext markup language and that's exactly what it is it's it's

00:32.110 --> 00:37.180
a markup language many people that are brand new to web development think it's actually a programming

00:37.180 --> 00:43.450
language but it's not a programming language is where you write code that can do things based on logic

00:43.720 --> 00:49.000
so you can check to see if something is true or false and then do some type of action based on that

00:49.000 --> 00:49.950
condition.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.810
You can do you also do things like math.

00:51.820 --> 00:55.240
You can create reusable functions and the list goes on.

00:55.240 --> 01:00.790
You can't do any of that with each team Al HDL is purely visual and it's used to create and construct

01:00.790 --> 01:04.050
documents that are viewable inside of a web browser.

01:04.090 --> 01:09.320
It doesn't have any any kind of behavior associated with it other than displaying content.

01:09.340 --> 01:13.530
And when I say content I mean text links images things like that.

01:13.540 --> 01:19.480
Now this isn't to minimize each team and in fact there is no Internet as far as the web browser goes

01:19.480 --> 01:20.710
without each team Al.

01:20.770 --> 01:24.610
It's extremely important and relevant and it always will be.

01:24.790 --> 01:30.760
Every single site that you visit displays its markup using HCM Al and sometimes it's it's handwritten

01:30.760 --> 01:34.280
sometimes it's actually generated by another programming language.

01:34.390 --> 01:40.040
But when you view the compiled source of a Web site you're always going to see Team markup.

01:40.060 --> 01:40.480
OK.

01:40.480 --> 01:47.520
Now HDMI all by itself is used to display content but it has little to no styling.

01:47.530 --> 01:50.730
So each time all on its own is very very ugly.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.650
And this is where CSX comes in.

01:52.650 --> 01:58.600
So CSX stands for cascading style sheets and it's what's called a styling language or a style sheet

01:58.600 --> 02:00.250
language like each team.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.830
It's not an actual programming language.

02:02.950 --> 02:06.660
It's purely visual only instead of being used to display content.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.450
It's used to style the content and style the way out.

02:10.450 --> 02:12.940
Now CSX is getting more powerful itself.

02:12.940 --> 02:18.060
You can now have things like variables you can do some calculations and so on.

02:18.130 --> 02:24.510
It can also be extended with something called SAS or less which are CSX pre compilers.

02:24.520 --> 02:30.090
We'll talk a little bit more about SAS later and in talk about some of the things you can do with it.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.730
But we're going to we're not we're going to do that much later.

02:33.790 --> 02:39.820
So basically these two go hand in hand each team all handles the content display CSX handles styling

02:39.820 --> 02:46.290
it with colors alignment fonts and everything else to do with with the styling.

02:46.330 --> 02:52.120
Now as you said web development includes a huge range of technologies to the point where sometimes it's

02:52.120 --> 02:53.430
very overwhelming.

02:53.560 --> 02:59.440
But these two are the building blocks because no matter how complicated the web application it still

02:59.440 --> 03:04.460
uses each Tim Allen CSX to display the visual appearance.

03:04.580 --> 03:08.860
Oh well let's take a web app like Facebook or Amazon.

03:08.890 --> 03:16.000
These are huge web applications that do things like have user accounts you can sign up register you

03:16.000 --> 03:18.550
can create posts on Facebook.

03:18.550 --> 03:22.340
Amazon does credit card processing she has a shopping cart.

03:22.420 --> 03:26.200
You can't have that functionality with just each Mellon CSX.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.660
You need some kind of back end programming language and there's a lot to choose from.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.450
And you also need a database for storage of user accounts in posts and stuff like that.

03:36.460 --> 03:42.010
Now this is stuff you're going to learn in another course but without each G.M. and CSX Facebook and

03:42.010 --> 03:48.130
Amazon ceased to exist because each team on CSX are responsible for displaying the content to you in

03:48.130 --> 03:53.920
a browser whether it's on a computer mobile device or tablet whatever it may be.

03:53.920 --> 03:59.560
So these two technologies are always the first ones that you're going to learn before moving to more

03:59.560 --> 04:03.670
advanced web programming to to build shopping cards and stuff like that.

04:03.820 --> 04:09.940
So you can kind of think of each team on CSX as the human body and you think of programming with other

04:09.940 --> 04:12.170
languages as the human brain.

04:12.190 --> 04:13.590
They both need each other.

04:13.690 --> 04:20.590
Now javascript is sort of in its own league because it is a programming language but it can run on both

04:20.590 --> 04:25.690
the front end with it which is within the browser as well as on the back end server.

04:25.690 --> 04:31.810
OK so JavaScript can be used in the front end for things like form validation click event stuff like

04:31.810 --> 04:32.530
that.

04:32.530 --> 04:39.350
So javascript is is probably the next thing you want to learn after a Jim Clancy ss.

04:39.430 --> 04:39.700
All right.

04:39.700 --> 04:46.810
So we've established basically the purpose of each team Alan CSX is to display web pages and style Web

04:46.810 --> 04:47.600
pages.

04:47.830 --> 04:54.280
So what can we do with just each team Alan CSX not knowing any other programming language.

04:54.370 --> 05:02.170
So after this course you'll be able to build any kind of static web site and by start I mean still so

05:02.470 --> 05:07.480
something where you're not creating user accounts you're not you're not creating posts things like that

05:07.750 --> 05:13.430
and a good example of a static web site is let's say a portfolio to display some of your projects a

05:13.450 --> 05:20.740
small business Web site maybe you know a plumber who wants a Web site where they can display their company

05:20.740 --> 05:27.340
info their contact info stuff like that plumber construction flower shop anything like that.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.170
Also informational and brochure Web sites.

05:30.200 --> 05:30.540
Okay.

05:30.550 --> 05:34.750
You can build some really really beautiful stuff with just age team on CSX.

05:34.750 --> 05:39.770
You just can't have that special kind of functionality like a shopping cart or something like that.

05:39.850 --> 05:42.780
You're going to need to learn more to do that stuff.

05:42.790 --> 05:45.480
You can also build the visual part of anything.

05:45.490 --> 05:51.910
So even an online store or a huge social network like Facebook you could build basically the shell of

05:51.910 --> 05:52.080
it.

05:52.090 --> 05:59.290
You'll just have to have a program or add the life to it where you can actually click post and have

05:59.290 --> 06:02.710
it post or upload an image or something like that.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.400
OK.

06:03.490 --> 06:07.900
So you can do that's this stuff with just each team Mellon CSX.

06:07.990 --> 06:11.020
And I'm going to show you all of this throughout the course.

06:11.020 --> 06:11.310
All right.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.670
So that's it guys in the next video we're going to start to set up our environment.

06:15.670 --> 06:21.600
We're gonna need something called a text editor so that we can actually write our age to Mellon's CSX.

06:21.760 --> 06:26.380
We're going to we're going to use something called V.S. code and we're going to install some extensions

06:26.380 --> 06:30.070
to to allow it to do some extra things for us.

06:30.070 --> 06:31.660
And of course you need a web browser.

06:31.660 --> 06:33.850
We're going to talk about all this in the next video.
