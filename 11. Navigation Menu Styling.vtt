00:00.560 --> 00:05.280
All right guys in this video we're going to style some menus so we're going to create verticals like

00:05.280 --> 00:11.580
side menu and then also a navigation bar that goes horizontal so create let's create a new file called

00:11.580 --> 00:23.460
0 9 underscore menus dot each team L and for the title I'm just going to say menu styling let's add

00:23.460 --> 00:30.810
in our style tags and for the markup we just want to add a U L and I'm gonna give it a class of side

00:30.810 --> 00:32.850
menu.

00:32.850 --> 00:37.780
Ok we're gonna have a list item with a link inside of it doesn't matter where it goes.

00:37.860 --> 00:43.080
And then let's just say home for the text and then we'll copy this down a few times.

00:43.070 --> 00:45.740
And this one will be about.

00:45.740 --> 00:52.320
This will be services and this will be contact.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.640
OK let's save that.

00:53.670 --> 00:56.400
Open it up.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.180
And there we go.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.150
Looks horrendous.

00:59.190 --> 01:09.230
First thing I'm going to do is for the body I'm just going to change the font family to do aerial.

01:09.420 --> 01:17.010
And next thing we want to target the side menu which is the UL and I want to get rid of the bullets

01:17.040 --> 01:22.450
because by default you always have these these disk bullets.

01:22.500 --> 01:30.660
Now you can get rid of these within the well or within the list item with the list style property and

01:30.660 --> 01:32.010
we want to set that to none.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.090
So we'll save that.

01:33.090 --> 01:34.370
That gets rid of them.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.890
See we also the aerial font.

01:36.960 --> 01:44.370
Next thing I want to do is add a border around the whole you well so we'll say border and let's set

01:44.370 --> 01:46.420
it to one pixel.

01:46.620 --> 01:54.270
I want to do a light grey so I'm going to do DDD and let's do solid save that.

01:54.300 --> 01:54.660
Good.

01:55.530 --> 01:59.660
Let's do a border radius just to add a slight curve.

01:59.670 --> 02:10.350
We'll do 10 pixels and let's set a width of 300 pixels kind of shorten and a little bit and let's set

02:10.350 --> 02:17.190
the padding now by default unordered list have 40 pixels padding on the left as you can see that's pushed

02:17.190 --> 02:17.870
over.

02:17.940 --> 02:22.350
So doing padding 20 pixels on all sides is going to overwrite that.

02:22.350 --> 02:27.410
So if I save that you can see now we have 20 pixels on all sides.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.750
And then I think yeah I think that's all I want to do for the well.

02:31.800 --> 02:42.420
So now we're going to focus on the list items themselves so side not slide side menu list items and

02:42.420 --> 02:49.290
we want to set the font size a little bigger by default at 16 we're gonna set it to 18.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.190
I think I have this zoomed in.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.670
Let me just see real quick.

02:53.700 --> 02:53.880
Yes.

02:53.910 --> 02:56.540
So that's that's normal that's 100 percent.

02:57.150 --> 03:01.410
So Font size 18 I also want them spread apart quite a bit.

03:01.410 --> 03:08.670
So I'm going to use line height and set it to two point four m save that and it's going to spread them

03:08.670 --> 03:09.230
apart.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.060
Let's see what else do we want.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.020
Here.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.180
Let's do a border bottom on each one

03:18.230 --> 03:25.640
and I'm going to do dotted for the style one pixel and the same color as the the well border.

03:25.860 --> 03:31.320
So you can see that each one now has this this bottom border.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.540
Now one thing I want to show you is that the borders are.

03:34.650 --> 03:40.100
I put them here to separate the links and we don't need the last one under contact.

03:40.110 --> 03:47.760
So we can actually use a pseudo pseudo selector called Last Child to target the last list item.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.790
So let's say it's a side menu.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.590
Ally colon last dash child.

03:53.930 --> 03:54.270
OK.

03:54.310 --> 03:59.250
And we'll get into some of the other pseudo selectors later on we can select the first one we can select

03:59.610 --> 04:06.000
anything in the middle we can do like all the even all the odd and it's pretty powerful but just for

04:06.000 --> 04:13.110
now we're going to use last child and set border to none and save and now the last link here or the

04:13.110 --> 04:16.070
last list item doesn't have a border.

04:16.110 --> 04:22.960
So for the the styling of the the actual links the colour and the underline we have to target the eight

04:22.970 --> 04:23.420
tags.

04:23.420 --> 04:27.730
So let's do side menu list item a.

04:28.410 --> 04:31.920
And change the color to 3 3 3.

04:31.980 --> 04:36.260
Let's get rid of the underline with text decoration none.

04:36.510 --> 04:43.910
Save that and for the hover right now it doesn't change at all.

04:43.910 --> 04:50.900
So I want to actually change the color for that so let's say side and on the why keep doing soft slide.

04:50.900 --> 04:57.710
Let's do ally a colon hover and let's change the color to coral.

04:58.730 --> 05:04.010
So now when I hover over a link it turns into the Coral color.

05:04.040 --> 05:04.300
All right.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.290
So I think that that's pretty much it.

05:06.290 --> 05:11.360
It's not the best looking menu but it looks a lot better than the standard unordered list.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.940
So now we're gonna move on to the navigation menu.

05:15.210 --> 05:18.640
So I'm just going to put a comment right here.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.670
Which side menu

05:23.450 --> 05:24.880
and down here.

05:24.880 --> 05:29.260
Let's just copy this up so I'm going to do shift option up.

05:29.440 --> 05:39.700
And this one I'm going to change the class to nav bar and let's just put a couple line breaks in between

05:39.700 --> 05:42.990
these two to kind of just separate them a little bit.

05:43.030 --> 05:43.360
All right.

05:43.360 --> 05:51.040
So this is our nav bar so we want this to be to go straight across and we want these links or the list

05:51.040 --> 05:53.200
items to float.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.970
So let's go under.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.630
Actually we'll go above.

05:58.630 --> 06:05.040
Since now bars at the top.

06:05.180 --> 06:05.500
All right.

06:05.530 --> 06:10.480
So we want to target the well which is called nav bar.

06:10.930 --> 06:14.350
And the first thing I want to do is remove the list the bullet.

06:14.350 --> 06:16.270
So we're gonna say list style.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.550
None.

06:18.550 --> 06:18.930
OK.

06:18.940 --> 06:24.280
Now I want to take away all the margin and all the padding

06:27.290 --> 06:28.000
save that.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.600
Good.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.080
Let's see.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.290
Next thing we want to do is add the background.

06:35.630 --> 06:47.960
I'm going to use that Facebook style blue which is for c 6 C a 0 K will save that let's add board a

06:47.960 --> 06:55.220
radius of five pixels OK.

06:55.460 --> 07:01.310
Now I'm gonna go down here and we're gonna say nav bar list item and we want to float these because

07:01.310 --> 07:03.020
we want them to be side by side.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.670
We don't want them to go down.

07:04.670 --> 07:09.950
We don't want them to be vertical so let's float all of the list items to the left.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.310
So they're kind of just stack side by side.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.850
So I'll save that.

07:13.850 --> 07:20.690
And it happened they float they float now to the left but the background is now gone since we floated

07:20.690 --> 07:21.270
it.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.810
It kind of just kind of collapse the background.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.260
So the way that we can fix this is go to the nav bar that the parent element and we want to add in overflow

07:33.980 --> 07:37.250
and set that to auto and save.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.330
And now we get the background back.

07:39.530 --> 07:39.900
All right.

07:39.920 --> 07:47.630
Because now the background is going to basically pertain to whatever content is inside of it and you

07:47.630 --> 07:49.560
can set this to hidden as well.

07:49.640 --> 07:55.700
If you have some some content that goes outside of the element and it has a scroll bar and lets say

07:55.700 --> 08:00.770
you don't want that scroll bar there you can set overflow to hidden and I'm sure we'll run into that

08:00.770 --> 08:01.670
later.

08:01.820 --> 08:06.710
But now that we have the background let's start to style the links.

08:06.710 --> 08:11.380
So we want to say nav bar ally a.

08:12.530 --> 08:16.910
And change the color to white.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.950
You will take away the underline

08:22.280 --> 08:23.840
save that.

08:24.300 --> 08:28.710
And we want to display his block.

08:29.240 --> 08:35.930
It's actually it's actually move this up to the top.

08:36.070 --> 08:36.870
OK.

08:36.890 --> 08:44.560
Now since we display block we we can add some padding and it's going to actually it's going to give

08:44.550 --> 08:46.490
us some space on the top bottom here.

08:46.490 --> 08:50.160
Also space in between all of the links.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.410
So let's say for each link we want some padding.

08:53.510 --> 08:59.330
We want to do 15 on the top and bottom and we want to do 20.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.800
On the left and right.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.270
So let's save that.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.260
And there we go.

09:03.260 --> 09:07.240
So it kind of filled out the wrapper that the nav bar.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.080
Well all right.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.180
So that looks pretty good.

09:12.440 --> 09:17.590
Let's make it so that when we hover over a link the background changes color.

09:17.630 --> 09:21.770
So I'm just going to make it a slightly darker than the blue it already is.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.390
So let's say nav bar

09:26.140 --> 09:32.270
the state I'm a hover and we're going to do a background

09:34.700 --> 09:46.370
color and that's going to be let's see what is that going to be 4 4 6 1 9 0 which is slightly darker.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.260
We can also change the color of the tax.

09:48.260 --> 09:51.680
We'll just do like a light gray slight change.

09:51.680 --> 09:56.990
So now if we go up and we hover you'll see that it changes the background and it takes up the whole

09:57.530 --> 10:00.490
the whole area of the link.

10:00.500 --> 10:06.500
Now sometimes you might see people put the padding on the list item but that's not really a good idea

10:07.190 --> 10:12.010
especially if you want to have the hover state take up the whole thing like this.

10:12.080 --> 10:18.230
Otherwise it would just take up like a square around it which doesn't look very good and you know you'll

10:18.230 --> 10:26.330
see different ways to create nav bars I think that this specific CSX is probably the easiest to do this

10:26.810 --> 10:31.970
and you'll see if I make this bigger it just stretches along if I make it really small.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.060
Well actually we don't have enough links here.

10:34.070 --> 10:39.530
But if we had more links it would just knock on to the next line which doesn't look very good.

10:39.590 --> 10:45.830
So later on I'm going to show you how to create a more responsive nav bar where it will kind of you

10:45.830 --> 10:52.100
know when you get to a certain screen size like like for a smartphone they'll actually switch to going

10:52.100 --> 10:52.800
this way.

10:52.890 --> 10:55.670
It'll look nice and neat centred and stuff like that.

10:55.670 --> 10:55.970
All right.

10:55.970 --> 11:01.080
So next I quickly want to look at the display properties UCLA did display block here.

11:01.130 --> 11:04.840
We can change in line to block in and vice versa.

11:04.850 --> 11:07.130
There's also something called inline block.

11:07.190 --> 11:10.250
So we're going to we're going to take a look at that in the next video.
