WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:00.920
All right guys.

00:00.930 --> 00:05.750
Now we're gonna get started with the the mobile version of the Web site.

00:05.760 --> 00:13.380
So let's make this a little smaller here and we're gonna have a few some styles are gonna vary whether

00:13.380 --> 00:16.650
it's a tablet or whether it's a smartphone.

00:16.650 --> 00:25.440
So basically for tablets I want I want this to be two columns OK.

00:25.470 --> 00:32.090
I want just two two columns but on mobile on smartphones I want it to be stacked in one column.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.350
But let's let's handle the navigation first.

00:34.380 --> 00:37.950
So the navigation is going to be the same on tablet and mobile.

00:37.950 --> 00:44.300
Now in our each team l files we already have a link to mobile CSX.

00:44.310 --> 00:48.330
And basically it kicks in when the screen is 768 or less.

00:48.330 --> 00:53.650
So let's let's keep Stiles the SS open so we can use this as a reference.

00:53.790 --> 01:03.540
And let's take mobile CSX and let's bring this over to the side here and let me see if I can only fit

01:03.540 --> 01:06.180
all this on here.

01:06.210 --> 01:16.990
Let's see if we can do this.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.310
That's all right.

01:19.310 --> 01:22.370
So hopefully this this works out for you guys that you can see this.

01:22.370 --> 01:23.330
Good.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.880
So let's start with the navigation.

01:24.890 --> 01:30.980
Now one thing right off the bat that I want to do is you get rid of the social icons unless it's on

01:31.340 --> 01:33.650
you know larger than 768.

01:33.680 --> 01:43.220
So let's put a comment here we'll say navigation and then let's take the main dash nav I.D. and target

01:43.220 --> 01:50.480
the class of social and let's set that to display none and save.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.530
So that we'll get rid of it.

01:51.890 --> 01:53.170
Now this doesn't look bad.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.230
It really doesn't.

01:54.230 --> 02:03.710
And in this would probably be fine if if if you never planned on adding any other links if you just

02:03.710 --> 02:09.150
had these two links home and about but I don't like to do things that way I like to to planet.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.380
You know I like to make it scalable basically.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.300
So we're going to switch this around a little bit.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.790
Let's take the navigation container.

02:18.140 --> 02:31.100
So we have main dash NAV and container and let's set the grid template columns to just one FDR.

02:31.140 --> 02:31.420
OK.

02:31.430 --> 02:33.750
So basically just on top of each other.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.950
And I'm also going to say grid gap.

02:36.950 --> 02:43.340
Let's do one point two Ram.

02:43.620 --> 02:44.030
All right.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.850
Now we want these to be centered right.

02:46.850 --> 02:49.280
So we're gonna take the well.

02:49.840 --> 03:00.160
So let's say main dash nav you add which is the menu and we're going to justify self to center.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.320
OK.

03:01.340 --> 03:11.910
So I do that it pushes it in the middle and then I think that's all I want to do with the well so here

03:11.910 --> 03:15.830
we had justified self end which pad all the way over.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.910
Now we have it in the middle.

03:17.910 --> 03:21.080
Now the logo we want to do the same thing.

03:21.180 --> 03:30.970
So actually what we can do is just add onto this main nav logo.

03:31.530 --> 03:33.960
And that puts it in the middle.

03:33.960 --> 03:38.540
Now for the link I want to lessen the padding just a little bit.

03:38.550 --> 03:42.650
So we have point seven five REM for the padding around this.

03:42.660 --> 03:55.980
But I want to make this a little smaller so let's say main NAV and you al ally a and let's change the

03:55.980 --> 03:56.850
padding.

03:56.850 --> 04:01.070
Two point five o room.

04:01.110 --> 04:01.630
So let's just.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.080
It just makes it a little bit smaller.

04:04.250 --> 04:04.590
All right.

04:04.590 --> 04:07.440
Now that's pretty much all we need to do for the menu.

04:07.470 --> 04:11.870
So you'll see as soon as we hit 768 it turns into that.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.780
Now it's still sticky of course.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.150
All right.

04:15.150 --> 04:25.010
Now for tablet size I want this right here on tablets I want this to be the same.

04:25.020 --> 04:28.360
So I'm going to leave that for now we're not we're not doing mobile yet.

04:28.380 --> 04:34.460
Ah I shouldn't say mobile tablets are also mobile but we're not doing small smartphone devices yet.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.720
So I'm going to leave this for now.

04:36.780 --> 04:44.310
Let's move on to this area which is the home articles and I want those to be in two two columns.

04:44.310 --> 04:54.390
So let's say home dash articles and it has an articles container which is our grid container and we're

04:54.390 --> 04:58.970
going to set grid dash template dash columns.

04:58.980 --> 05:02.970
And let me just show you over here what we have it's set to.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.880
So we have it set to repeat three one far.

05:07.200 --> 05:14.070
But I just want it to say I'm going to say repeat to one far.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.350
All right.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.130
We'll save that.

05:19.890 --> 05:25.570
So let's see the first child here yeah.

05:25.580 --> 05:32.500
We want to get rid of these spans because that's kind of that's kind of ruining things.

05:32.540 --> 05:44.060
So let's grab the first child so we'll say home articles and we want to target articles container and

05:44.060 --> 05:54.170
we want the immediate element the immediate first child element and let's set grid template columns

05:54.170 --> 05:56.320
because remember the first and the last there.

05:56.330 --> 06:02.490
There are also grids as you can see right here and they have grid template columns of 2 1 at far.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.600
We just want to set it to a single column.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.380
So just one file like that.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.280
All right.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.250
And then we want to clear the span because right here you can see we're doing the span.

06:12.590 --> 06:19.190
So I'm going to say grid dash column and just set it to 1 which is just the default.

06:19.490 --> 06:22.280
So let's save that.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.360
Now this is put back into just it's just like the rest of them.

06:26.390 --> 06:28.980
Let's do the same for the last one.

06:29.300 --> 06:41.350
So we can actually just copy this and put a comma here and then change this to last child save that.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.320
And there we go.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.950
So now we just have two columns OK.

06:45.000 --> 06:45.900
No matter what.

06:46.050 --> 06:49.060
First and last are the same as the rest.

06:49.110 --> 06:49.390
Good.

06:49.390 --> 06:53.030
Now I think that's that's good for the tablet.

06:53.030 --> 06:54.240
In fact let's check it out.

06:54.240 --> 07:03.350
So actually we'll use our chrome tools here and lets me just move this to the side and we'll hit the

07:03.810 --> 07:07.530
little icon here for the devices and this would be an iPad.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.120
Let me just stretch to so.

07:09.210 --> 07:15.150
And right now this iPad is in landscape mode so I'm going to just flip it and this is what it's going

07:15.150 --> 07:16.090
to look like.

07:17.550 --> 07:17.900
OK.

07:17.910 --> 07:25.440
Which which looks pretty good even though the footer I'll keep like that for our devices that are 768

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
like this.

07:26.820 --> 07:31.450
But on smaller devices like let's choose iPhone X.

07:31.830 --> 07:32.880
This doesn't look right.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.580
So we want this to be in the middle.

07:35.580 --> 07:41.700
So just take up the whole thing here and then I want these to all be stacked the footer is definitely

07:41.850 --> 07:43.870
not responsive.

07:43.950 --> 07:48.270
So we want that to be stacked as well about page.

07:48.270 --> 07:51.750
We want to change that up the page container.

07:51.780 --> 07:53.310
Same thing with the article page.

07:53.310 --> 07:56.630
So now let's deal with smaller devices.

07:56.670 --> 08:03.130
So I'm going to get out of this mode here and bring this back down.

08:03.580 --> 08:14.340
And now in this mobile dot CSX I'm going to I'm going to add a media query so going to say media and

08:14.340 --> 08:23.190
I'm going to do a max width of let's say six hundred pixels and then anything we put in here is only

08:23.190 --> 08:26.680
going to pertain to anything under 600 pixels.

08:26.700 --> 08:30.450
So let's let's take what we need to stack.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.710
Meaning I want just one column.

08:32.910 --> 08:38.750
So I'm going to say stack grid items and there's a few things I want.

08:38.790 --> 08:39.680
I want to do that too.

08:39.670 --> 08:41.580
One is going to be the showcase container.

08:41.580 --> 08:48.360
This right here if you're a member or I can just show you real quick let's see showcase

08:50.250 --> 08:54.880
showcase container is set to grid template columns.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.010
Repeat to 1 5.

08:57.030 --> 09:02.180
We want it to just be just one at far so we're going to take this luxury.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.430
We should probably put the select there here first.

09:05.430 --> 09:16.480
So it's a showcase dot showcase container and we just want to change this to just simply one at far

09:17.970 --> 09:18.520
like that.

09:18.540 --> 09:24.720
And if we save now that goes all the way across there's some other things you want to stack such as

09:24.720 --> 09:26.650
the these home articles.

09:26.790 --> 09:31.020
So let's say home I.D..

09:31.020 --> 09:40.410
Home Articles and we want the container which is articles container and we want those to stack.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.540
So we'll save.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.710
There we go.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.090
So that looks pretty good

09:49.170 --> 09:51.300
yeah.

09:51.830 --> 09:52.130
All right.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.690
So what else.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.320
The footer.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.770
So we want these footer items to stack.

09:57.770 --> 10:04.620
So let's go ahead and put a comma here and let's say main dash footer.

10:04.820 --> 10:24.420
We want the footer container and save and it didn't work when that work means footer.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.970
Why isn't working

10:29.800 --> 10:31.020
we called it mean footwear.

10:31.040 --> 10:31.730
Correct.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.210
Let's just check it over here.

10:35.390 --> 10:36.530
So have main footer

10:39.780 --> 10:49.480
for the container and it set off basically for one Fa oh you know what it is it's the span the last

10:49.480 --> 10:52.110
child here we span so we want to clear that up.

10:52.110 --> 11:00.910
So let's take this the selector right here and put that in and let's grab the.

11:00.940 --> 11:06.010
What was it the last child is what we span so let's say last child

11:09.350 --> 11:13.730
he got the cone and then we want to set the grid column

11:16.940 --> 11:24.560
to 1 and save and now it stacks because if you have something spanning however many columns four columns

11:24.560 --> 11:25.510
it's going to it's going to.

11:25.520 --> 11:33.050
You can't have just one f far it's going to it's going to adapt to whatever the amount of columns that

11:33.050 --> 11:34.040
you're spanning.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.590
So we want to set make sure that that set to 1 All right.

11:38.590 --> 11:44.290
Now another thing I want to do here is this looks kind of really clumped together.

11:44.330 --> 11:50.390
So I want to add a faint border between the modules here or whatever you want to call these these these

11:50.390 --> 11:51.090
items.

11:51.770 --> 12:05.390
So let's go and say main footer and take the footer container and let's say all items in the footer

12:05.390 --> 12:06.080
container.

12:06.080 --> 12:15.930
I'm going to add a border bottom of four four four dotted one pixel and then some padding just a separated

12:15.950 --> 12:16.240
a bit.

12:16.250 --> 12:26.000
So we'll say padding dash border and let's set that to one room and that's what's going on here.

12:26.030 --> 12:31.560
Padding I see padding border with the parking bottom.

12:32.770 --> 12:33.170
OK.

12:33.170 --> 12:38.680
So as you can see now we have a border separating all of these with some padding now.

12:39.050 --> 12:44.810
This one here doesn't look right because of the we have the list items and we have a border for each

12:44.810 --> 12:45.080
one.

12:45.080 --> 12:49.620
So this kind of looks funny having it's like it looks like a double border really.

12:49.640 --> 12:54.100
So I want to remove that one and remember we have the end child.

12:54.110 --> 12:55.630
I also want to remove this one.

12:55.670 --> 13:00.500
I don't think that that needs to be there because this has its own background and it looks completely

13:00.500 --> 13:01.280
separate.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.460
So that's pretty easy to do.

13:04.460 --> 13:14.480
We can just say main footer for our container and then let's say we want the item we want the last child.

13:14.480 --> 13:22.580
So Colin last child and then we also want just copy this.

13:22.580 --> 13:27.080
We want this one here which is going to be the third one down.

13:27.080 --> 13:27.350
Right.

13:27.350 --> 13:31.340
The third item so we'll use any child.

13:31.340 --> 13:35.230
So any child three.

13:35.960 --> 13:42.650
And let's just set border to none and save.

13:42.710 --> 13:47.450
And now you can see that that border is gone and oh actually you know what.

13:47.510 --> 13:54.390
We don't want the last child would be this one which I guess yeah we would want to move that remove

13:54.390 --> 13:57.540
that one but if we want to move this one as well we can use and child

14:00.370 --> 14:02.140
so we'll copy that and let's do.

14:02.140 --> 14:06.010
And child 4 and save.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.160
And now that board is gone.

14:08.410 --> 14:08.760
All right.

14:08.800 --> 14:14.000
And we could we could have done it the opposite way and just chose this first first child.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.500
And child 2 and just added a border we did that as well I guess that that probably I guess that would

14:20.500 --> 14:22.780
be a better way to do it.

14:23.800 --> 14:28.990
Yeah let's actually do it that way it's less it's less CSX and I'm not gonna cut this out of the video

14:29.020 --> 14:32.000
because I just want to show you you can do things different ways.

14:32.050 --> 14:39.280
So instead of doing this instead of putting a border on all and then removing let's just pick out the

14:39.280 --> 14:50.270
first child so first dash child and then the end child 2 and we'll add the border and then we.

14:50.270 --> 14:53.510
There's no need to do this and it's less CSF.

14:53.510 --> 15:01.580
So if I save we get the same result so we just added the border here and here instead of to all and

15:01.580 --> 15:02.300
then removing it.

15:03.070 --> 15:03.350
All right.

15:03.350 --> 15:08.090
So I mean you know I could cut that out and just redo it but I want you guys to see that there's there's

15:08.090 --> 15:14.310
different ways to do things and sometimes you realize that when you're writing your code.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.260
I think you'll see what we have left the page container.

15:18.530 --> 15:24.590
So right now I mean this is done on the home page but if we go to a boat that doesn't look right and

15:24.590 --> 15:26.720
it's you know it's way too thin.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.700
So we just want to put this.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.420
We want to stack this into one column.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.550
So one that fire basically.

15:33.560 --> 15:44.780
So let's take the page container in let's say grid template columns one at far so we're gonna stack

15:44.780 --> 15:45.170
it.

15:45.320 --> 15:51.900
And I also want to align everything to the Center on on really small screen so we'll do text align center.

15:51.920 --> 15:56.460
Now if I save this sea wall.

15:56.630 --> 16:00.350
Yeah I guess that does work.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.620
Let's look at the article page.

16:04.540 --> 16:04.970
Yeah.

16:05.070 --> 16:07.480
That that works.

16:07.920 --> 16:14.050
But I do want to clear the row span because remember we do have a row span.

16:14.060 --> 16:24.620
If we look at sea or is it if we look at the page contain a first child we have a grid row spanning

16:24.620 --> 16:34.460
here so I'm going to just grab that and we're gonna set grid row just to one and save all right.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.880
So that looks pretty good.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.790
So our site is now complete.

16:37.790 --> 16:38.170
Let's go.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.890
Let's go ahead and check it out in the actual devices.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.360
So we'll open up our dev tools here.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.470
Click that icon.

16:45.470 --> 16:48.580
So this is an iPhone X.

16:48.590 --> 16:53.300
Everything looks pretty good footer is stacked.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.000
We have our two borders.

16:56.030 --> 16:56.270
Yeah.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.200
So that looks pretty good.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.080
Let's check the about page.

17:00.080 --> 17:00.600
All right.

17:00.610 --> 17:05.210
That's that's quite a bit of text there and we probably didn't need that much text but that's fine.

17:05.210 --> 17:10.670
And if you guys want to add onto the I would actually suggest that you add onto these projects you know

17:10.670 --> 17:15.250
add more pages add more little widgets and stuff like that.

17:15.290 --> 17:18.130
Let's see what do we have the article page.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.340
Take a look at that.

17:20.870 --> 17:24.020
Looks pretty good if you want to stack the Flex items here.

17:24.020 --> 17:27.400
You could do that but I think that that's OK.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.790
Yeah.

17:28.970 --> 17:29.780
Everything looks good.

17:29.810 --> 17:33.230
Let's check a pixel too.

17:33.250 --> 17:33.860
Yeah same.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.160
Same deal.

17:35.180 --> 17:41.870
Let's check the iPhone 5 which is sometimes hard to to make look good.

17:41.870 --> 17:46.540
But I think that this is pretty good about page.

17:46.640 --> 17:53.220
Oh you know what we should do is lessen the font size for the L heading on mobile devices.

17:53.360 --> 18:02.360
So we'll say l dash heading I think I have it set to three rooms so let's set font size to two.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.610
OK.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.130
And yeah.

18:05.140 --> 18:06.270
That looks that looks.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.900
That looks better.

18:07.910 --> 18:14.300
All right guys hopefully you enjoyed this project and hopefully you learned quite a bit about how to

18:14.300 --> 18:17.270
use CSX grid and that's it.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.230
Thanks for watching guys.

18:18.230 --> 18:18.920
I appreciate it.
