WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:00.500
OK.

00:00.540 --> 00:02.220
So we have the home page done.

00:02.220 --> 00:07.260
Now we want to move on to the about which is completely empty right now if I click on it it's just a

00:07.260 --> 00:08.460
blank page.

00:08.490 --> 00:14.190
So what I'll do is copy what we have in the index because we're gonna be reusing some of this stuff

00:14.190 --> 00:19.470
like the nav bar in the footer and also some of the head the stuff in the head.

00:19.470 --> 00:24.790
So I'm just going to copy it all I'm going to just control a to select it all and then copy it and control

00:24.790 --> 00:31.070
C and let's go into about h t email and paste it in and start at the top here.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.020
Now if you want to leave the same meta tags description keywords you can do that.

00:36.090 --> 00:38.180
We don't need this this link to the font.

00:38.210 --> 00:43.760
Awesome because we're not using any icons on this page so we can completely get rid of that.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.650
We want to keep the reference to our style CSX because that's where all of our customers styling goes

00:49.980 --> 00:56.580
for the title I'm going to change the Welcome to about and then we have our header which had initially

00:56.580 --> 01:01.530
has the nav bar and the showcase but we're not going to be using the showcase so let's get rid of this

01:01.530 --> 01:04.440
whole div with the idea of showcase and everything in it.

01:05.040 --> 01:12.210
So now the header only has the NAV and we want to move the current class off of the home link or link

01:12.240 --> 01:18.750
because we want that to go on to the about whatever the current pages is what we want highlighted and

01:18.750 --> 01:21.300
then we can get rid of everything else up to the footer.

01:21.330 --> 01:25.170
We just want to keep the footer so let's save that.

01:25.170 --> 01:28.830
And now if we click on a boat we just have our header and footer.

01:28.830 --> 01:34.670
So this is basically like the start for any page that we create on this Web site.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.580
And when you start to get into like let's say BHP or some javascript framework stuff like that you don't

01:41.580 --> 01:44.910
have to reuse reuse your aged him.

01:44.940 --> 01:50.940
I like this you'll be able to like import files and stuff but that's that's later on that's after you

01:50.940 --> 01:52.000
learn HCM islands.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.430
Yes.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.080
So let's go ahead and create this.

01:57.090 --> 01:57.580
Where is it.

01:57.630 --> 01:58.470
Right here.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.100
We want it.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.500
We have basically two sections on the about page.

02:01.510 --> 02:03.540
It's gonna be the about info section.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.270
This is gonna be the testimonial section.

02:06.270 --> 02:11.850
So right under header I'm going to put in a section tag and I'm gonna give it an idea of about Dash

02:11.880 --> 02:21.360
info and inside here we want a container because we want all the content to be contained and we'll have

02:21.360 --> 02:23.640
info left and in full right.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.250
So info left class.

02:27.540 --> 02:30.810
And under that let's do info right.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.360
Class.

02:33.000 --> 02:45.730
So info left is gonna have a heading in each one and we're gonna do about hotel B T.

02:46.410 --> 02:54.840
And I'm gonna wrap the text about in the the text primary class inside of a span because I wanted what

02:54.960 --> 02:57.810
I wanted to have that that tan color.

02:57.810 --> 03:07.030
So it's a class text primary and we want that span to just wrap around the about word like that.

03:07.410 --> 03:16.290
And then underneath the H one let's put a paragraph and let's do say Lorem do alarm 30 and then let's

03:16.290 --> 03:21.010
do one more paragraph and let's do Lorem 20 like that.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.630
So that's the left side.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.150
Now on the right we're just going to have an image.

03:27.150 --> 03:34.230
So let's put an image tag in the source is gonna be dot slash because we're looking in the current directory

03:34.530 --> 03:39.670
and then we want to go into the image directory and we actually want photo to dot j peg.

03:40.050 --> 03:40.980
And for the all.

03:41.010 --> 03:46.770
I'll just put in the word hotel so let's save that see what we get.

03:46.770 --> 03:52.100
So we have the heading we have the paragraph this is in.

03:52.110 --> 03:54.890
This is info left and then info right.

03:54.900 --> 04:00.660
We just have the image in here which is the full size image as you can see you can scroll way way over

04:00.660 --> 04:03.600
it's actually a really large image.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.480
So let's add our CSX to get this looking better.

04:07.520 --> 04:07.790
OK.

04:07.800 --> 04:14.520
So we'll go to our style sheet and go all the way down.

04:14.670 --> 04:18.300
So put in a comment.

04:18.300 --> 04:22.230
Actually no let's leave the footer at the bottom I always like to keep the styling of the footer at

04:22.230 --> 04:33.090
the bottom but let's put a comment here and say about info we have our ideas about Dash info and let's

04:33.090 --> 04:39.000
see for boat info actually you know what.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.510
I don't think we have any specific style for that part just just that particular div what I do want

04:45.510 --> 04:46.050
to do

04:49.220 --> 04:56.420
is I want to add a big class one of our utilities I want these BGP light so in addition to the idea

04:56.420 --> 05:05.630
of about info let's add a class of BGP light and save and as you can see it's very faint but it is grey

05:05.660 --> 05:06.440
it's not white.

05:07.300 --> 05:07.730
OK.

05:07.730 --> 05:10.890
And then for the info right let's style that.

05:10.910 --> 05:15.820
So about info and then there's a class of info right.

05:16.100 --> 05:25.340
And we want to float to the right and we want to set the width to half 50 percent and just going to

05:25.340 --> 05:33.620
set a min height of 100 percent and let's see for the image.

05:34.260 --> 05:34.510
OK.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.560
This and this in this image is in line.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.160
It's not a background image.

05:38.330 --> 05:41.650
And by default it'll break out of its container.

05:41.660 --> 05:47.990
So usually with images you want to set the width to 100 percent because what it does is it contains

05:47.990 --> 05:52.070
it 100 percent of its container which in this case is in full right.

05:52.070 --> 05:54.430
So when to copy this right here.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.940
I'm going to copy that.

05:56.600 --> 06:04.010
And we want to say image you want to target the AMG tag and then we want to set the width of the image.

06:04.010 --> 06:06.690
Actually you know what I'm going to do 70 percent.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.950
So we'll say with 70 percent.

06:10.190 --> 06:13.120
And we also want to display it as a block.

06:13.430 --> 06:20.600
And if you remember back in the section where we talked about the display block display inline I showed

06:20.600 --> 06:26.840
you an example of an image and I wanted to align it in the middle but we couldn't do margin Auto on

06:26.840 --> 06:30.550
the image because an image by default is displayed in line.

06:30.560 --> 06:38.400
So that's why I'm going to display this block because I want to set the margin to auto.

06:38.420 --> 06:38.710
All right.

06:38.780 --> 06:40.220
Let's save that.

06:40.220 --> 06:40.520
Good.

06:40.520 --> 06:46.780
Now we want to take this which is in info left and we want to float it to the left.

06:46.820 --> 06:59.750
So let's let's go right here and we'll say about Dash info the class info dash left and flow to the

06:59.750 --> 07:09.440
left we'll set the width to 50 percent and the men height to 100 percent and save.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.290
And there it goes.

07:10.310 --> 07:13.500
Now we have that floated to the left.

07:13.610 --> 07:15.970
Now we need some spacing here right.

07:15.980 --> 07:20.120
Because it's right up against the header it's right up against the footer.

07:20.750 --> 07:27.280
So a lot of times what I'll do is I'll add a utility class for padding and sometimes for margin.

07:27.290 --> 07:35.300
So I'm going to go to my stop my utilities up here utility classes that we've been creating and let's

07:35.300 --> 07:36.640
create one for padding.

07:36.650 --> 07:38.810
So we'll see padding.

07:39.170 --> 07:46.100
We'll just say padding and let's do some p y padding and what I mean by p y want to do.

07:46.190 --> 07:49.950
Make this a class what I mean by P Y is the y axis.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.630
So padding for the top and bottom.

07:52.790 --> 08:00.870
And let's do P Y 1 and we'll make that padding on the top and bottom 10 pixels.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.530
OK.

08:01.580 --> 08:11.150
We could even since this is only going to be one property we could go like that and copy it down and

08:11.150 --> 08:17.300
then we'll do p y two even if we're not using them right now we could have them available for the future

08:17.300 --> 08:22.190
if we were going to add more pages so let's say 20 pixels 30 pixels.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.430
OK so we have these different padding classes now.

08:25.900 --> 08:30.920
I'm going to save it and I'm gonna go and add one to the about info.

08:31.280 --> 08:39.590
OK so right here about info in addition to be light let's do padding y dash 3 which should be 30 pixels

08:39.590 --> 08:40.740
on the top and bottom.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.900
Let's save.

08:42.020 --> 08:42.770
And there we go.

08:42.800 --> 08:48.650
Now we have some spacing here and then whenever we have a section where we want to add some padding

08:48.650 --> 08:53.010
to the top and bottom we can simply put in one of these utility classes.

08:53.030 --> 08:58.030
So this is this stuff is is it's not mandatory.

08:58.040 --> 09:03.770
I mean we could put up put padding on the about info but I think it's much cleaner to do it this way

09:04.040 --> 09:08.540
because you have these classes that are available to you whenever whenever you want as opposed to just

09:08.540 --> 09:14.240
having you know senseless padding in and background colors for every single element.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.010
You just have these classes you can add kind of like a framework.

09:18.170 --> 09:18.470
OK.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.330
So let's move on here.

09:22.490 --> 09:23.720
What else did I want to do.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.570
I think that's all we want to make the image circle.

09:26.640 --> 09:34.970
Ok well we want to add a radius to the image so to do that we just need to go back to our CSX and go

09:34.970 --> 09:43.340
down to where we have our image which is we've written credit quite a bit of CSX already.

09:43.400 --> 09:50.090
So right here this is this I am G tag we just want to add a border radius to this so we'll see a border

09:50.120 --> 09:54.770
dash radius so we're going to set it to 50 percent and save.

09:54.770 --> 09:57.660
And now you'll see that it's a circular image.

09:57.740 --> 10:03.920
Now the last thing I want to do is make this heading bigger because right now I have it as an H1 which

10:03.920 --> 10:06.350
is the biggest heading and I still want the text bigger.

10:06.590 --> 10:13.000
So I'm going to add a class to it and I'm going to call this L dash heading.

10:13.040 --> 10:18.230
So we'll call the wheel so we'll do large heading and we'll use this as a utility because we can use

10:18.230 --> 10:20.100
it on other headings as well.

10:20.180 --> 10:32.210
So let's go up here and see we'll go right under the clear right here and say dot l dash heading and

10:32.240 --> 10:38.950
I'm just going to set the font size to let's do 40 pixels and save.

10:39.020 --> 10:39.760
And there we go.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.930
Now the text is bigger.

10:41.930 --> 10:45.890
So let's move on to the next section which is going to be the testimonials.

10:45.890 --> 10:49.550
And since we have the clear I mean we have the floats here.

10:49.670 --> 10:55.040
We have to clear them so we're going to add a class of clear which we already have in our C Ss and then

10:55.040 --> 11:01.350
we'll add our section with the idea of testimonials.

11:02.120 --> 11:09.400
And I'm also going to have a class here of P Y three because I want to add padding here as well.

11:09.530 --> 11:13.610
Then we want our container so you can see the you can see the pattern here.

11:13.760 --> 11:18.770
It's just sections stacked on top of each other and then we have our container to move the content in

11:18.770 --> 11:24.470
the middle if we want some kind of background image or something we put it on the section which I'm

11:24.470 --> 11:29.220
actually gonna do so inside the testimonials.

11:29.270 --> 11:32.270
Let's see we're going to have a heading.

11:32.300 --> 11:40.880
Let's do an H two but I'm also gonna give this a class of L dash heading because I want it to be large

11:40.910 --> 11:46.940
and we'll say what our guests say.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.380
OK so those are H two.

11:49.730 --> 11:57.200
Let's add a testimonial so basically we're gonna have two testimonials here and we're gonna give them

11:57.470 --> 12:05.660
a class of testimonial and also big primary because we wanted that we want them to have this tan background

12:06.140 --> 12:08.510
so let's do a class of testimonial

12:11.090 --> 12:17.770
and inside the testimonial we're gonna have the image of the person.

12:17.780 --> 12:26.710
So this is going to go to slash image and then let's check person 1 dot j peg for the all time and we'll

12:26.720 --> 12:35.030
just give her a name we'll say Samantha and then under the image is the testimonial so it'll be a paragraph

12:35.060 --> 12:37.550
and let's do Lorem 40

12:41.300 --> 12:42.680
so that's one testimonial.

12:42.680 --> 12:51.920
And I'm gonna give the div here also a class of BJP primary which will give it that color that background

12:51.920 --> 12:52.480
color.

12:52.670 --> 13:00.620
And then we can just copy this whole div the whole testimonial and go on to the next round here and

13:00.620 --> 13:05.200
just change the image to Person 2 and we'll change the name is it.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.160
They both female.

13:06.160 --> 13:06.370
Yeah.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.090
So we'll just change the name to.

13:08.090 --> 13:10.000
I don't know Jen.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.730
So let's save and take a look.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.570
OK so it doesn't look too good.

13:15.620 --> 13:20.880
So let's go ahead and add some C Ss so right below the where we did the about stuff.

13:23.900 --> 13:33.110
Let's do I.D. testimonials and I want the height to be six hundred pixels.

13:33.500 --> 13:42.490
And let's give it a background image of let's do you are Al it's gonna be outside of the CSF folder

13:42.490 --> 13:46.650
into the images folder and then into and then we want to test Fiji.

13:46.950 --> 13:53.560
K We don't want it to repeat we'll do center center slash cover.

13:53.560 --> 14:01.330
We want the whole image to show and then let's add let's do a padding top of 40 pixels just to push

14:01.370 --> 14:04.660
that as the heading and all this stuff down right here.

14:04.690 --> 14:04.930
All right.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.180
So this is the testimonials.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.020
Six hundred pixels area.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.450
And as you can see everything is is busting out and it's because of the size of the images.

14:13.810 --> 14:20.770
So I'm going to grab those images so let's say testimonial.

14:20.920 --> 14:28.150
And then each one of those testimonials has a class of testimonial and then I'm going to grab onto the

14:28.150 --> 14:30.900
image and I'm going to give it.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.450
Let's see.

14:31.450 --> 14:45.000
Let's do a width of one hundred pixels and save Wait a minute up this should be testimonials.

14:45.220 --> 14:51.670
OK so now that the images are smaller it doesn't bust out of its container anymore so let's see.

14:51.670 --> 14:52.710
Let's let's do this.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.520
Let's start from here and go down.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.580
So this H to what's needed to I believe

15:00.100 --> 15:07.990
say testimonials dot want to target the H two.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.600
And we're gonna set the color to white.

15:11.350 --> 15:14.560
And let's let's align it to the center.

15:14.560 --> 15:22.060
So text align center and let's do padding bottom 40 pixels

15:28.350 --> 15:29.420
why isn't that.

15:29.450 --> 15:36.090
Or oh I put it so I put this testimonial attack and this H two is not within either of these divs and

15:36.090 --> 15:38.220
these divs have the classic testimonial.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.080
So this is wrong.

15:39.090 --> 15:43.420
We just want that there we go.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.870
OK so let's see.

15:45.930 --> 15:53.970
So for the testimonial Div I want to add some styles for that so I'm going to copy this because that

15:53.970 --> 15:55.200
one's for the image.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.510
This is for the actual div.

15:57.510 --> 16:03.570
I'm going to set some padding to 20 pixels.

16:03.570 --> 16:06.010
Let's do some margin bottom just to push.

16:06.150 --> 16:08.120
Push them down.

16:08.990 --> 16:13.920
And if we added more testimonials with the debt with a div with the class of testimonial this would

16:13.920 --> 16:16.200
apply to those as well.

16:16.320 --> 16:21.690
So it's the margin bottom 40 pixels let's do over.

16:21.810 --> 16:25.590
Actually I'll do that after let's save that.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.810
And then I want this the image to float to the left.

16:30.810 --> 16:31.320
OK.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.110
And we don't have to make the text float to the right.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.360
It'll automatically push the text over.

16:36.360 --> 16:45.530
So in the image let's say float left and save.

16:45.600 --> 16:45.920
OK.

16:45.960 --> 16:51.050
Now the images float to the left and it's right up against the edge though.

16:51.090 --> 16:56.960
So I'm going to add some margin right to the image to push the text over.

16:57.240 --> 17:03.420
So margin right to 20 pixels push the text over.

17:03.420 --> 17:12.480
Let's also make the image rounded so add a border radius of 15 percent.

17:13.110 --> 17:13.730
And there we go.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.840
That looks pretty good.

17:16.890 --> 17:20.250
Let's see for the testimonial itself.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.740
Let's give that let's could do us a little bit of a rounded corner here.

17:24.780 --> 17:30.060
So the testimonial class I'll do border dash radius.

17:30.060 --> 17:31.940
Let's do five pixels.

17:32.010 --> 17:37.670
So it has a little bit of a rounded corner and then I want it to be a little bit see through.

17:37.800 --> 17:46.320
So in CSX we have a property called opacity where we can make the the element opaque so basically transparent

17:46.320 --> 17:54.630
and we can add a value from 0 2 0 to 1 where 1 is is what it is now.

17:54.630 --> 17:56.040
Not see through at all.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.470
And zero is completely transparent.

17:58.620 --> 18:03.770
So basically the higher the the the less transparent.

18:03.780 --> 18:08.040
So I want to do zero point nine because I want it to be barely transparent.

18:08.070 --> 18:15.390
So right here for our testimonial div let's do opacity zero point nine and save.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.520
And you can see you can barely see through it.

18:17.670 --> 18:22.070
If I do zero point five and save now you can really see through it.

18:22.100 --> 18:29.550
But the problem here is when you have when you add opacity to a div like this it also makes everything

18:29.550 --> 18:30.870
within it opaque.

18:30.870 --> 18:36.480
So even the text we can't really read the image we can see through and that's not really what we want

18:36.960 --> 18:42.780
even if we wanted the background to be really see through like this really transparent and we wanted

18:42.840 --> 18:48.480
the text to be really readable we would have to do something different we'd have to add another element

18:48.810 --> 18:51.740
and then make just the background see through.

18:51.740 --> 18:56.150
So basically we'd have to add an overlay and I'm going to show you how to do that later on.

18:56.190 --> 19:01.110
Now right now if you want it to be just a little bit see through then you could add it to the whole

19:01.110 --> 19:07.080
div like we are now because it's it's such a small amount that the text is still readable the image

19:07.350 --> 19:08.900
you can still see the image.

19:09.030 --> 19:12.530
But at the same time it's still a little opaque.

19:12.570 --> 19:16.590
OK so I'll show you how to do an overlay later on.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.950
So I think that's it.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.090
Yeah that looks pretty good.

19:21.140 --> 19:21.570
Let's see.

19:21.570 --> 19:22.670
Let's compare it with that.

19:22.710 --> 19:23.240
Yeah.

19:23.340 --> 19:24.450
So that's good.

19:24.450 --> 19:28.930
Wait why is it that I missed some padding.

19:28.940 --> 19:31.790
I think I did see

19:34.990 --> 19:35.550
testimony.

19:35.590 --> 19:36.160
Oh I had.

19:36.160 --> 19:36.490
You know what.

19:36.490 --> 19:38.500
I had one hundred pixels padding on the top.

19:40.330 --> 19:41.830
There we go.

19:41.860 --> 19:42.780
OK.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.430
So that's our ball page.

19:45.550 --> 19:46.170
It's nothing.

19:46.180 --> 19:50.380
I mean there's not a ton of content but I think it looks pretty good.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.960
I think the home page looks pretty good.

19:51.970 --> 19:57.430
So especially if this is your first Web site in the next video we're going to start on the contact page

19:57.430 --> 19:58.660
which just has a form.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.600
We have some icons and and that should be it.

20:01.630 --> 20:01.900
All right.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.010
So I'll see you in the next one.
