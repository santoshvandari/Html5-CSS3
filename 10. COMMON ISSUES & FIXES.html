<p>Here are a couple things to mention and/or people have had issues with along with some fixes to try. They will be added to the videos in the next update.</p><p><br></p><h4>1. OVERLAY NOT GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN</h4><p>Make the #showcase </p><p><code>position: relative;</code></p><p><br></p><p>Make #showcase .showcase-content</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">position:absolute;
top:0;</pre><p><br></p><p>Make sure in your mobile media query, you remove the following or it will go outside the image</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">  #showcase .showcase-content {
    top: 110px;
  }</pre><p><br></p><h4>2. FLEX ITEMS NOT EVEN WHEN USING FLEX:1</h4><p>This is happening in the what and contact section</p><p> "flex-basis" is used to set the initial size of a flex item. Try adding the following...</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">#who div {
  flex: 1;
  flex-basis: 50%;
}</pre><pre class="prettyprint linenums">#contact .map, #contact .contact-form {
  flex: 1;
  flex-basis: 50%;
}</pre><p>Helpful Link: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis</a></p><p><br></p><h4>3. GOOGLE MAP NOT DISPLAYING</h4><p>Unfortunately, the Google map API is not completely free anymore.  You do get a $200 credit, so you do not have to actually spend any money to use it in this course. I use maps all the time in tutorials and have still never been charged.</p><p><br></p><p>More Info Here</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/</a></p><p><br></p><p>If you want to completely disregard the map, just fill that area with whatever you want such as an image, placeholder map, location info, etc..</p><p><br></p><p>Sorry for not mentioning it in the video, I completely forgot they started charging For the Google APIs. I have had my credit card linked for a long time so I was not prompted and I have never been charged by Google for maps.</p><p>It really sucks when free services decide to start charging people. I have run into this about 3 times in my courses.</p>
