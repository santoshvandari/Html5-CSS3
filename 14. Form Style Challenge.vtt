00:00.430 --> 00:03.390
All right guys so now I'm going to give you a challenge.

00:03.390 --> 00:05.940
I want you to style a form that looks like this.

00:05.940 --> 00:09.030
It doesn't have to be exact but something similar.

00:09.030 --> 00:11.670
That looks pretty decent and clean.

00:11.670 --> 00:17.160
So I'm gonna give you all the H T.M. I'm gonna give you even that the classes and all the elements were

00:17.160 --> 00:19.410
styling along with some hints.

00:19.440 --> 00:27.210
So in the in this lecture you should find a file called form styling underscore start date each team

00:27.210 --> 00:27.660
out.

00:27.870 --> 00:34.830
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a file called Twelve underscore form underscore

00:35.580 --> 00:42.060
styling dot H team L and I'm gonna grab everything that's in that start file and paste it in and just

00:42.060 --> 00:43.530
go over it real quick.

00:43.530 --> 00:51.720
So let me just close this up and let's take a look at the H Team Alpha so we have an idea of container

00:51.720 --> 00:59.810
that wraps around everything and then we have an eye class of form wrap that wraps around the form.

00:59.980 --> 01:06.350
OK so this part right here we have an H1 a paragraph and then in our form we have some fields.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.250
Each one is wrapped in a div with the class of form group and inside the form group.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.360
We have the label.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.790
We also have the input.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.010
OK.

01:15.030 --> 01:19.680
So we have first name last name email password confirmed password.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.480
Then we have a button which which has a class of B10.

01:24.690 --> 01:25.040
OK.

01:25.060 --> 01:28.380
Then we have a paragraph which is this part right here.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.320
And underneath the form wrap.

01:31.320 --> 01:35.470
We just have a footer that says already have an account log in here.

01:35.490 --> 01:37.330
So that's the markup for this.

01:37.410 --> 01:42.450
Now up here you have everything that's going to be styled all the styles that I'm going to add along

01:42.450 --> 01:43.800
with some hints.

01:43.860 --> 01:47.520
So I'm going to go along and just give you some hints here.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.460
So as you can see I actually brought in a font from Google fonts called railway.

01:53.160 --> 01:57.450
So just that you want to you want to use that as your font family.

01:57.570 --> 01:59.410
I have an asterisk here.

01:59.430 --> 02:05.060
It says may want to add Border box for box sizing so padding does not affect the width.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.260
We've talked about that quite a bit.

02:07.290 --> 02:12.310
We should also reset the margin and padding in the body.

02:12.330 --> 02:16.000
I'm just saying the background color is going to be this right here.

02:16.020 --> 02:21.540
Now I'm not saying that that's all you need to put in the body or that's all you should put it's just

02:21.540 --> 02:22.400
a hint.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.100
OK.

02:23.130 --> 02:25.830
In the tags underlines or ugly.

02:25.830 --> 02:29.190
So you probably want to remove those container.

02:29.250 --> 02:34.800
So remember margin Auto on the left and right will center a block element.

02:34.860 --> 02:39.530
So you want to center the container and remember margin auto.

02:39.570 --> 02:39.990
All right.

02:40.020 --> 02:44.330
And I'd also suggest using a max width for responsiveness.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.980
You also may want to add some padding.

02:47.190 --> 02:54.060
Now the form wrap is the white area around the form so this whole box right here around the form in

02:54.060 --> 02:55.450
the heading and all of that.

02:55.470 --> 03:01.080
So figure out how to style that the H1 in the paragraph you want to center these.

03:01.080 --> 03:10.310
Remember the text line property the form wrap or the form group I should say each label and input is

03:10.310 --> 03:11.780
wrapped in the form group.

03:11.780 --> 03:13.820
So this is a form group right.

03:13.850 --> 03:20.550
So you may want to add some margin separating these labels should be turned into a block element.

03:20.580 --> 03:20.910
OK.

03:20.910 --> 03:25.260
Because we want the label to be on its own line and we don't want to use line breaks.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.690
I only use line breaks to give you guys examples.

03:27.690 --> 03:30.430
You don't want to use those in your actual layout.

03:30.600 --> 03:37.290
So turn that into a block element so that the next element pushes on to the next line inputs should

03:37.290 --> 03:42.770
reach across the form wrap 100 percent and have some padding by default inputs are very ugly.

03:42.770 --> 03:47.350
They're very thin and it'll only it won't go across the whole thing.

03:47.460 --> 03:52.380
So you might want to set the width to 100 percent and add some padding.

03:52.380 --> 03:57.420
So the format button which is this right here should wrap across 100 percent.

03:57.420 --> 04:03.300
It should also be displayed as a block OK background color is this next right here.

04:03.540 --> 04:07.410
The hover is this color for the button.

04:07.410 --> 04:13.200
Let's see the bottom text is smaller so you might want to set the font size smaller for the bottom text

04:13.560 --> 04:17.160
footer which is this right here should be centered.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.100
So remember text line and the footer color.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.860
I'm sorry the footer link color is this right here.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.570
So that's a lot of hints.

04:24.570 --> 04:29.460
So I'm going to give you guys this is a challenge to try and recreate this.

04:29.550 --> 04:29.910
OK.

04:29.910 --> 04:35.610
And don't just skip it really try it if it looks absolutely insane and nothing like this.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.440
Don't worry about it.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.830
Don't get discouraged.

04:37.830 --> 04:42.530
It's kind of a tough challenge if you're just learning CSX but just give it a shot.

04:42.570 --> 04:42.930
OK.

04:42.930 --> 04:47.580
And then in the next video I'll go over it and I'll give you all my styling and it doesn't even have

04:47.580 --> 04:48.770
to match mine.

04:48.870 --> 04:49.160
OK.

04:49.170 --> 04:53.850
As long as it looks decent so I'll see you in the next video which will be the conclusion.
