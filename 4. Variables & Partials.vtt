00:00.270 --> 00:03.410
All right guys so we're going to jump back into our SAS sandbox.

00:03.420 --> 00:11.130
Now remember we have the the SAS script the NPM script so I'm going to run NPM run SAS.

00:11.130 --> 00:16.830
We're going to want to run that when we're in development and then in our index each team l let's open

00:16.830 --> 00:18.270
that with a live server.

00:18.940 --> 00:19.260
OK.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.260
And it should be blue if you've been following along.

00:22.260 --> 00:31.640
And if I go ahead and into my SAS main dot SPSS and they change this to let's say black and save it'll

00:31.860 --> 00:33.840
it'll reload automatically.

00:33.870 --> 00:34.190
All right.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.280
But I want to set that back to blue now variables.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.140
I mean you can see how they're used.

00:40.140 --> 00:46.620
We use a money sign to define a variable and then we simply use a colon for assignment and then whatever

00:46.620 --> 00:48.350
the value goes in here.

00:48.350 --> 00:48.670
OK.

00:48.690 --> 00:56.190
So it could be a color it could be absolutely anything just just like with standard CFS variables.

00:56.220 --> 01:01.050
So I think what we'll do here is just create a couple different ones.

01:01.050 --> 01:06.690
Let's do primary dash color set to steel blue.

01:06.690 --> 01:12.730
We're going to just create kind of a simple interface to to work with for the next few lectures.

01:12.870 --> 01:24.420
So we'll do secondary dash color and we'll set that to Sky Blue and let's do a light color

01:28.300 --> 01:34.620
and a dark color.

01:35.020 --> 01:35.890
OK.

01:36.150 --> 01:45.550
So as far as this CSX here for now I'm just going to add a reset.

01:46.530 --> 01:47.850
So say margin

01:51.780 --> 01:55.870
padding 0 and then let's just add some stuff for the body.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.780
So the background I'm going to set to the white color

02:03.380 --> 02:04.980
in color.

02:04.980 --> 02:11.820
I'm going to set to for now I'll just set to the dark color and then for font family

02:15.130 --> 02:16.380
we can do aerial.

02:16.400 --> 02:22.010
Actually know what we'll do is we'll take this and we'll put this in a variable called font stack

02:28.900 --> 02:30.850
just in case we want to change that.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.050
It's right up here.

02:32.050 --> 02:36.350
Easily accessible so we'll set that to font stack.

02:36.350 --> 02:36.720
OK.

02:36.730 --> 02:39.220
And then let's just set a line height.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.900
It's completely up to you guys what you want to put in variables in your projects and what you don't.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.990
I try to keep them a minimal amount.

02:46.030 --> 02:52.440
Usually things that are gonna be you know use quite a bit in different places but yes.

02:52.450 --> 02:56.020
So that's how we can set variables I'll go ahead and save that.

02:56.020 --> 03:00.510
Now we also have what are called partials.

03:00.540 --> 03:00.750
OK.

03:00.790 --> 03:06.690
So a lot of times the SAS you break your CSX up a lot more.

03:06.970 --> 03:13.930
For instance if you use bootstrap which is a CSX framework and you use SAS every element like the button's

03:13.960 --> 03:20.770
the nav bar they all have their own separate partial file with just those styles so you can really break

03:20.770 --> 03:21.030
it out.

03:21.040 --> 03:28.720
Now you can import these partials into a CSX and to a SAS file and it's important to mention you can

03:28.720 --> 03:30.570
do this with regular CSX.

03:30.580 --> 03:32.080
However it works differently.

03:32.080 --> 03:40.380
You make you you have to keep making extra HDP requests to the server to fetch these the regular CSX

03:40.390 --> 03:45.370
files with SAS it just kinda takes them and builds them on top of each other.

03:45.370 --> 03:45.640
All right.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.340
So it's just much more efficient using SAS partials.

03:49.450 --> 03:57.670
So in our SPSS I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to call it underscore variables dot SPSS.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.790
So this is a partial where I want to store all my variables.

04:00.790 --> 04:07.720
Now notice I put an underscore the reason for that is this tells the SAS compiler that this is a partial

04:07.720 --> 04:10.450
and I don't want this file to be compiled.

04:10.450 --> 04:18.550
I don't want a variables dot c SS file in my main in my CSF folder I still we still want to keep just

04:18.550 --> 04:20.280
one file here.

04:20.440 --> 04:26.800
However we want to split it up here so I'm going to take all my variables here and cut them out and

04:26.800 --> 04:32.180
I'm going to put them into variables dot CSX and save that.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.530
Now if I go back here and I save we're gonna get some errors down here.

04:35.550 --> 04:40.900
It's another good thing about SAS is it gives you errors and tells you what's going on so this is basically

04:40.900 --> 04:43.740
telling us we have undefined variables.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.820
So in order to use the variables in the partial we have to import the files.

04:47.830 --> 04:56.170
So we're gonna go up here we're gonna say at import and we want to import variables.

04:56.260 --> 05:03.790
You don't want to put the actual underscore the underline you also don't have to put dot SPSS just simply

05:03.790 --> 05:05.200
variables.

05:05.200 --> 05:05.600
All right.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.230
And then I'll go ahead and save that.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.270
And now that's working again.

05:09.430 --> 05:19.230
If I go to variables and change light color to red just to show you and I say actually you know what

05:19.230 --> 05:24.460
we'll have to restart SAS down here just because we created a new file.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.460
So let's run that.

05:26.630 --> 05:30.960
And now if we save this now it turns to red.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.250
All right.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.210
So I'm just gonna put that back

05:35.850 --> 05:36.790
and save.

05:36.810 --> 05:37.530
Good.

05:37.650 --> 05:44.040
So you can see we can structure our SAS however you want and notice that it didn't create a variables

05:44.040 --> 05:46.250
dot CSX because it is a partial.

05:46.260 --> 05:53.010
If I left that underscore off then it would have compiled this whole file into the CSX folder and we

05:53.010 --> 05:53.670
don't want that.

05:53.670 --> 05:57.990
We just want this single main dot CSX.

05:57.990 --> 06:01.340
And notice it's using the light gray that we set in the variable.

06:01.680 --> 06:06.150
And you never want to touch the CSX that that gets compiled from SAS.

06:06.150 --> 06:06.390
All right.

06:06.390 --> 06:11.370
So in the next video what I want to do is finish up our index each team also can get some markup in

06:11.370 --> 06:11.940
here.

06:11.940 --> 06:18.900
And we're also going to look at nesting in structure within SAS which is very important and in a really

06:18.900 --> 06:20.820
nice advantage of using SAS.
