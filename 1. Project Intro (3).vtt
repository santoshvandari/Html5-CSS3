All right guys in this video I just want to show you the next project we'll be building which is a portfolio

00:05.640 --> 00:07.880
project that uses SAS.

00:07.890 --> 00:08.190
OK.

00:08.190 --> 00:15.510
Now the inspiration for the look of this site comes from a template that I found on Moby rides dot com.

00:15.510 --> 00:21.660
So I just wanted to show you guys this real quick and it's just a one page is just a single page our

00:21.660 --> 00:24.080
templates is gonna be multiple pages.

00:24.150 --> 00:27.210
I didn't even look at the H team L of the CSX for this.

00:27.300 --> 00:33.900
And then as far as this typing effect here the typing effect we're using comes from my javascript tutorial

00:33.900 --> 00:34.880
on youtube.

00:34.920 --> 00:40.500
So if you're interested in the actual javascript you can just search for JavaScript typing effect and

00:40.590 --> 00:47.510
the first result here will be my tutorial that shows you exactly what's going on as far as this course

00:47.520 --> 00:49.400
we're just going to kind of include the file.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.020
So we have a landing page here with a background image.

00:54.150 --> 01:00.360
This logo up here JD pertains to the the the developers name John Doe.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.880
Now I did include the PSAT file if you want to change the initials if you want to use your own logo

01:05.880 --> 01:07.540
if you want to use text here.

01:07.590 --> 01:12.020
If you don't want to use anything here whatever you want to do is fine if you're going to use this as

01:12.030 --> 01:13.890
your own portfolio or whatever.

01:14.070 --> 01:18.460
And then we have the menu over here with the different pages which I'll show you in a second.

01:18.480 --> 01:24.690
We have a button to go to the work page and then down here we have what John specializes in some font

01:24.720 --> 01:26.250
awesome icons.

01:26.250 --> 01:32.610
And then here we have some more icons with the clients awards hours worked projects completed creative

01:32.610 --> 01:39.960
process so down here we're gonna add some visual effects using transitions footer is pretty simple just

01:39.960 --> 01:46.200
have some social media icons with a hover effect and then the about page you can see we're still using

01:46.200 --> 01:51.660
that same background image but we're pushing it up into the nav bar and then we have the about section

01:51.660 --> 01:57.350
we're actually going to be using grid template areas here then we have some progress bars.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.540
So we'll be creating these from scratch.

01:59.550 --> 02:05.130
I know that progress bars are included with frameworks like bootstrap and stuff like that but we'll

02:05.130 --> 02:07.110
be creating these with just age.

02:07.110 --> 02:11.820
Tim Allen CSX we have some logos here some testimonials.

02:11.820 --> 02:19.020
And then on the work page we have some images with some overlay effects case we'll be using some CSX

02:19.020 --> 02:25.980
transitions here as well that looks pretty nice all these images will be included in the project files

02:26.010 --> 02:31.410
as well so let's take a look at the contact page which is very simple we just have a form here.

02:31.410 --> 02:37.710
We have this section with the email phone and address big Texas says let's start your next project and

02:37.710 --> 02:38.850
the footer.

02:38.850 --> 02:39.120
All right.

02:39.120 --> 02:44.920
So now let's take a look at the responsiveness of this I'm going to open up my chrome tools and let's

02:44.920 --> 02:47.180
set the device icon here.

02:47.180 --> 02:52.800
So this is what it would look like on an iPad which is very similar to what it looks like on desktop.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.920
Basically everything is is pretty much the same.

02:56.970 --> 03:02.420
So let's look at say iPhone X okay.

03:02.450 --> 03:10.140
So on smaller devices smartphones we're just going to kind of narrow the header down to just the logo

03:10.170 --> 03:15.770
and the menu centered and then everything else is just nicely stacked on top of each other.

03:15.780 --> 03:22.280
OK for the about page you can see everything's nicely stacked testimonials progress bars the work page

03:22.290 --> 03:29.440
we just have the images and then the contact page everything is nice and stacked as well.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.470
All right so that's the responsiveness of it.

03:31.470 --> 03:33.750
So that's it guys hopefully you enjoy this.

03:33.750 --> 03:37.410
Let's jump into the next video and start to set up our SAS environment.
