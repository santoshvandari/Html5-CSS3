WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:04.010
All right guys in this video we're going to talk about backgrounds and borders.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.690
And I'm going to use the full the full screen editor and full screen browser because I want to utilize

00:09.720 --> 00:11.250
all the space here.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.240
Now notice that I have a folder called I Am G.

00:14.250 --> 00:20.780
This is an image folder and I have two images one is a star's dot JPEG file which is this image here.

00:20.790 --> 00:25.500
I'm going to use as a background and then I have a leaf dot P and G which you can't really see because

00:25.500 --> 00:29.070
it's transparent and it's on it's on a dark background.

00:29.070 --> 00:33.520
Now one thing to remember is j peg files or jpeg images.

00:33.600 --> 00:40.770
They can't be transparent like this one is PMG files can have a transparent background where you can

00:40.770 --> 00:46.170
put it on any web page like let's say the Web pages are red background and it will show red behind this

00:46.170 --> 00:52.230
image if it were a j peg it would have to have a solid color it couldn't be transparent so just remember

00:52.230 --> 00:56.190
that if you want transparency then use PMG image.

00:56.190 --> 00:56.480
All right.

00:56.490 --> 01:04.200
So what we're gonna do now is create a file called 0 5 underscore backgrounds underscore borders dot

01:04.340 --> 01:15.480
each team L and let's put in our boilerplate here and for a title we'll save backgrounds and borders

01:16.340 --> 01:18.690
set in our style tags.

01:18.890 --> 01:22.040
And as far as each time all goes we're gonna have four Divs.

01:22.770 --> 01:27.580
So the first one is going to have an I.D. of box dash one.

01:27.610 --> 01:27.930
OK.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.410
She wanted div with the idea of box 1.

01:30.510 --> 01:38.520
We're going to put an H 3 and just say Box 1 for the title and we want a paragraph with let's say 20

01:38.520 --> 01:38.910
words.

01:38.910 --> 01:41.690
So we'll do lawn 20.

01:41.860 --> 01:42.270
OK.

01:42.270 --> 01:46.620
And then what I'm going to do is just highlight this whole div and I'm going to copy it down with shift

01:46.890 --> 01:53.520
shift option or shift Ault on windows and then we're going to hit the down key three times.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.790
Now we have four divs and then we're just going to change the I.D..

01:56.790 --> 02:03.850
So one two and three and four and then I will change the text as well and we'll probably use this H

02:03.850 --> 02:09.860
to email in a couple different lectures that's three and four.

02:09.870 --> 02:10.150
OK.

02:10.170 --> 02:15.300
So let's save this and let's open it up with live server and it should look like this.

02:15.350 --> 02:19.890
Case we have our four divs and we're gonna style the first one.

02:19.890 --> 02:30.240
So let's go back and let's target the I.D. of Box 1 and we're gonna use the background spell background

02:30.240 --> 02:31.360
right.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.940
We want to use the background color property.

02:33.960 --> 02:40.920
Now when you want to assign a color to text obviously we use the color property we've already talked

02:40.920 --> 02:46.230
about that if you want to style the background color the background you use background color.

02:46.410 --> 02:51.960
And I'm just gonna choose this Blanch almond doesn't really matter what what color we use.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.480
But if I go ahead and save this and we take a look.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.420
Notice that this whole div now has that background color.

02:58.470 --> 02:58.770
OK.

02:58.770 --> 03:04.800
And it's going to take up however however much space that the element takes up or the div remember divs

03:04.800 --> 03:10.770
or block level so this is going to go all the way across by default unless we set a width on it or something

03:10.770 --> 03:12.180
like that.

03:12.180 --> 03:15.330
And I know the text is right up against the edge.

03:15.450 --> 03:16.860
That's because there's no padding.

03:16.860 --> 03:22.130
I'm going to go for margin and padding and lecture very soon.

03:22.260 --> 03:30.210
So let's head back into our editor here and I want to go over border OK now border has three mandatory

03:30.210 --> 03:31.040
properties.

03:31.170 --> 03:36.890
So the first one is gonna be width and this can be in any order but we're going to do with first.

03:36.890 --> 03:38.810
So let's say three pixels.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.310
Now if I just just do that and take a look.

03:41.310 --> 03:46.680
We have nothing there's no change because we need all three properties the next one is gonna be the

03:46.680 --> 03:47.720
color.

03:47.820 --> 03:52.970
So we want to say border dash color and let's just do red.

03:53.190 --> 03:59.520
And then the last one is gonna be border style which can be dashed dotted double groove.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.320
The most popular is gonna be solid.

04:01.320 --> 04:06.060
That's probably the most common that you'll use which is just a solid regular border.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.580
So let's save that and let's take a look.

04:08.580 --> 04:12.400
And now we have a three pixel wide red solid border.

04:12.400 --> 04:12.660
OK.

04:12.660 --> 04:18.710
And just to give you an idea of some of the other styles we can do like dotted for Take a look at that.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.610
That's the dotted border.

04:20.730 --> 04:22.650
And what else we have dashed

04:25.240 --> 04:29.670
that stash is similar to dotted but it's there are wider lines.

04:29.670 --> 04:35.790
But for the most part you're probably going to be using solid the most now using all three properties

04:35.790 --> 04:36.510
like this.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.770
We don't have to do it this way and this isn't the preferred way.

04:39.900 --> 04:44.580
What we can do is just use the single border property and we can actually add all three of those in

04:44.580 --> 04:44.940
here.

04:44.940 --> 04:50.570
So three pixels solid red and it doesn't matter the order either you can use any order.

04:50.730 --> 04:56.750
And if I comment this so I'll highlight this and do control forward slash or control question mark that

04:56.760 --> 05:00.780
will comment that out if I save with Troll ass and take a look.

05:00.780 --> 05:01.910
We have the same thing.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.970
OK so this is the exact same as doing this.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.800
It's just less lines of code.

05:08.480 --> 05:08.720
OK.

05:08.760 --> 05:15.660
So that's border let's say we want to do just border on the top.

05:15.660 --> 05:16.360
Actually no it will.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.820
We'll grab the next one.

05:17.850 --> 05:23.340
Let's do box 2 and let's actually give this a background.

05:23.340 --> 05:29.100
Now we can also use just background if we want to add a color or background image which I'll get into

05:29.100 --> 05:30.000
in a second.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.980
But let's give this a dark background and let's give it a color text color of white.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.340
And let's say we just want a border on the top.

05:41.340 --> 05:50.180
We can just do border dash top and let's say we want to do blue solid three pixels.

05:50.180 --> 05:50.510
OK.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.980
So we save that and we take a look.

05:52.980 --> 05:57.040
Now we just have a border on the top so you can do border talk.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.560
Border bottom border left and border right.

06:00.570 --> 06:00.960
All right.

06:00.960 --> 06:07.770
So now I want to take a look at the border radius property because by default our corners are just straight

06:07.770 --> 06:08.210
corners.

06:08.220 --> 06:10.140
But we can rounded off if we want.

06:10.680 --> 06:15.820
So I'm actually going to comment out the border top or not I'll leave it.

06:15.820 --> 06:16.440
I'll leave it.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.450
But what I do want to do

06:21.510 --> 06:30.180
what I do want to do is just add a line break between these two box one and box two.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.070
There we go.

06:31.080 --> 06:35.890
So let's say that this top one here I want rounded corners.

06:35.940 --> 06:38.400
So for that I would use a border radius.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.860
So I'm gonna go to box 1.

06:39.880 --> 06:46.690
Going to say border radius and we can put percentages here we can put pixels.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.300
Let's say 10 pixels.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.800
That's pretty common.

06:49.860 --> 06:53.070
And if we take a look now we have rounded corners.

06:53.070 --> 06:58.920
Now before CSX three there was no border radius property we actually had to create little images of

06:58.920 --> 07:05.460
corners rounded corners and then position them perfectly so that it looked rounded like that which was

07:05.460 --> 07:06.990
a huge pain in the butt.

07:07.020 --> 07:13.560
And if you're just learning each team on CSX now you Hey you missed a lot of crappy stuff that we used

07:13.560 --> 07:14.700
to have to do before.

07:14.700 --> 07:22.770
Each team of five and CSX three just to just to let you know that now if we wanted to just add rounded

07:22.770 --> 07:24.830
corners to like let's say the top.

07:24.830 --> 07:34.140
We can do that as well so let's take box to let's say border dash top dash left dash radius.

07:34.140 --> 07:38.190
I know that's a long property and let's say 10 pixels.

07:38.190 --> 07:43.350
So if we take a look at that notice that only the top left is rounded.

07:43.350 --> 07:43.580
OK.

07:43.590 --> 07:48.930
So we can choose which corners we want around and let's say we just want the whole top.

07:48.930 --> 07:53.610
So we'll just copy this down and we'll do right as well.

07:53.610 --> 07:53.970
All right.

07:53.970 --> 07:57.930
Now if we look at that both of the top is rounded.

07:57.930 --> 08:02.790
Now you don't even have to have a border property to use border radius like we could still round the

08:02.880 --> 08:05.830
bottom edges even though there's no border.

08:05.850 --> 08:06.210
OK.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.620
So that doesn't matter.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.350
So next thing I want to look at is the background image property.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.630
A lot of times you might want to have some kind of image is your background.

08:15.630 --> 08:23.800
So let's use box 3 and let's use the background dash image property.

08:23.820 --> 08:30.390
So this is going to actually take in you are ill and in here we could use a remote image like we could

08:30.390 --> 08:34.480
do each GDP and then locate some image on the Internet and use that.

08:34.530 --> 08:40.230
But what we want to do is target the stars dot JPEG file that's in our image folder.

08:40.290 --> 08:40.560
Ok.

08:40.560 --> 08:46.890
And since our image folder is local in our directory here we can just do dot slash that represents the

08:46.890 --> 08:48.100
current directory.

08:48.240 --> 08:53.940
Then we want to go into the image directory and then we want to call the stars dot JPEG file.

08:55.080 --> 08:55.400
OK.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.970
So let's save that and let's go back and notice that it uses the background image.

08:59.970 --> 09:04.140
Now you're not going to see you don't see the whole image because it only takes up the space of the

09:04.140 --> 09:05.370
actual element.

09:05.370 --> 09:05.790
OK.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.430
And this is the whole div right here.

09:08.430 --> 09:12.000
Now we can make this bigger by setting a height.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.950
We can set a height in width and CSX.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.420
Let's also change the color of the text because it's unreadable right now.

09:18.450 --> 09:28.590
So we'll see color white and let's give it a height of let's say 300 pixels and let's give it a width

09:29.160 --> 09:33.270
of 600 pixels and let's save that and take a look.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.980
And there we go so now we have our background image.

09:36.010 --> 09:43.250
We have a width of 300 and the height of I'm sorry width of six hundred and the height of three hundred.

09:43.260 --> 09:48.780
So with background image or I should say with background you have a bunch of other properties just like

09:48.780 --> 09:52.280
with border one of those as background repeat.

09:52.290 --> 09:56.770
Now you can't see it here but let's say this image was only like this big.

09:56.820 --> 09:57.340
OK.

09:57.350 --> 09:58.770
It ended right here.

09:58.800 --> 10:04.610
It would repeat both this way on the x axis and this way on the y axis.

10:04.680 --> 10:09.120
And usually you're not going to want that unless it's some kind of seamless texture that you want to

10:09.120 --> 10:13.100
repeat like as it has some kind of seamless background.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.300
But for the most part you're not going to want that.

10:15.290 --> 10:23.010
So let's go ahead and set the background dash repeat property and there's a few options here you can

10:23.010 --> 10:24.660
do repeat which is the default.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.340
It repeats both ways.

10:26.370 --> 10:31.110
Repeat x will only repeat on the x axis which is horizontal.

10:31.110 --> 10:34.350
Repeat Y will go on the up and down the y axis.

10:34.350 --> 10:38.490
But what we want is no repeat because we don't want to repeat.

10:38.650 --> 10:39.180
Okay.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.720
Another property is the position property.

10:42.720 --> 10:47.250
So let's say background position and this will move the image around.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.630
It takes in to values.

10:48.630 --> 10:52.770
The first is going to be the x axis and the second is the y axis.

10:52.770 --> 10:59.470
So let's do one hundred pixels let's just do one hundred pixel zero and see what happens here.

10:59.500 --> 11:05.980
So what happened is on the x axis it pushed it over 100 pixels and it actually leaves a blank space

11:05.980 --> 11:07.300
here.

11:07.300 --> 11:15.300
Now if I do 100 pixels in the y axis try to try to guess what's going to happen so let's save that and

11:15.300 --> 11:18.980
take a look and it pushes it down.

11:18.990 --> 11:20.450
One hundred pixels.

11:20.490 --> 11:26.610
Now let's say you wanted to move it up and over 100 pixels so that the image didn't actually get pushed

11:26.610 --> 11:30.290
out of the out of its context here or its wrapper.

11:30.300 --> 11:38.760
So let's go back and what we can do is we can do negative values now if we take a look.

11:38.760 --> 11:44.150
What happened is the image went up 100 pixels and over this way 100 pixels.

11:44.160 --> 11:49.920
Now you also have keywords you can use like top center and bottom so let's say we wanted to center and

11:49.920 --> 11:53.100
center on both axis.

11:53.420 --> 11:53.740
OK.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.010
And you can see what it did is it just centered it.

11:56.130 --> 12:01.940
If I wanted to take the y axis and move it up to the top we could do that as well.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.930
And this might not be the best image to use as an example because it's just stars it's not something

12:06.930 --> 12:12.510
that you can actually tell what position it's in but just know that we can move it you know top bottom

12:12.510 --> 12:15.250
center and so on.

12:15.360 --> 12:22.500
Now in most cases you're going to want the whole image to cover the background and that's not what's

12:22.500 --> 12:23.250
going on here.

12:23.250 --> 12:29.940
It's just it's the size of the image which I believe is 1920 by 10 80 so that the image is really like

12:29.940 --> 12:30.600
this big.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.940
It's like the whole window.

12:32.940 --> 12:37.950
Now let's say we we just want the whole image to show in this spot what we could do is we can add a

12:37.950 --> 12:46.110
background size property and we can set that to cover this case it's going to cover the whole space.

12:46.110 --> 12:48.980
If we take a look now the whole image is showing.

12:49.020 --> 12:54.300
It doesn't matter how what size the images it's going to adjust it's going to take up the whole space

12:54.300 --> 12:56.100
right here.

12:56.100 --> 12:56.450
All right.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.870
So that's a lot of different properties right for the background.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.950
There's even more than that.

13:00.960 --> 13:06.750
But let's say that we want to do exactly what we're doing here but we don't want to take up all this

13:06.780 --> 13:09.590
this these lines with all these different properties.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.340
We can actually just use background.

13:12.340 --> 13:12.550
OK.

13:12.570 --> 13:15.620
So when I use background I'm going to do the same exact thing we just did.

13:15.620 --> 13:20.370
So we're gonna take the U.R.L. and then after that we want the no repeat.

13:21.750 --> 13:27.330
And then after that we'll do the position let's do center to center center.

13:27.330 --> 13:32.020
And then when you want to put the size and you just do a slash and then cover like that.

13:32.040 --> 13:40.230
So if I go ahead and comment this out and save and take a look we get the same result with much less

13:40.230 --> 13:42.900
lines of code much less properties.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.350
OK so let's move on.

13:45.390 --> 13:50.750
I want to look at a bar having a fixed background and I'll show you what I mean.

13:50.750 --> 13:58.620
So let's add in our box for and this time I'm going to set background.

13:58.620 --> 14:03.120
Now when you want to set an image you don't have to use background image you can use just background.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.420
Even if you don't want to add of all this other stuff we did up here.

14:07.620 --> 14:15.600
So let's do U.R.L. and let's go in the current folder and then into the image folder and we want leaf

14:15.600 --> 14:17.220
dot P and G.

14:17.240 --> 14:17.480
OK.

14:17.490 --> 14:22.260
And I'm just gonna do a no repeat.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.960
All right now let's save this and see what we get.

14:27.830 --> 14:32.180
So notice that it's just because the image is bigger like the image is this big.

14:32.240 --> 14:37.250
It's not going to show the whole image it's only going to cover whatever the content area covers which

14:37.250 --> 14:37.790
is this.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.660
This right here.

14:39.660 --> 14:47.710
So let's see what I'm going to do is set actually no.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.500
We'll do is will add more content.

14:49.680 --> 14:58.530
So in box for let's take this paragraph and let's just copy it down like a bunch of times a lot and

14:58.530 --> 14:59.450
save that.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.800
And now take a look.

15:01.020 --> 15:07.020
And now notice that it shows the whole image because the content area is bigger.

15:07.020 --> 15:12.030
If we manually set a height like we did here we'd be able to see the whole image as well.

15:12.030 --> 15:17.910
But I want to show you how we can make a make this a fixed image and to give you an example let me just

15:18.000 --> 15:21.180
make this smaller so we have a more of a scroll.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.900
Now if I scroll see all the image just kind of stays in place.

15:24.930 --> 15:26.550
We can make it fixed.

15:26.550 --> 15:35.280
So let's go back up to box for and let's actually position it differently too so let's let's do

15:38.150 --> 15:41.890
center bottom.

15:41.910 --> 15:54.050
See what that looks like so now it's out Senator bottom do center center.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.580
Now it's it's dead center.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.310
Now I wanted to stay fixed.

15:58.320 --> 16:02.500
So I'm going to add a a background attached.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.210
I'm sorry.

16:03.270 --> 16:06.950
Background attachment property.

16:08.550 --> 16:13.010
And let's say fixed and let's save that.

16:13.020 --> 16:21.450
And now watch when I scroll the image just stays in place and it's fixed to the to the browser window.

16:21.480 --> 16:21.810
OK.

16:21.810 --> 16:27.110
So if you want to do that then you want to use the background attachment fixed.

16:27.150 --> 16:27.420
All right.

16:27.450 --> 16:31.680
So that's going to be it for this video guys in the next one we're going to start to talk about the

16:31.680 --> 16:38.880
box model which has to do with margin and padding and just how spacing works in NC SS.
