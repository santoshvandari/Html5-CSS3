WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:04.980
All right so now we're going to start to make our hotel Web site responsive because there's some things

00:04.980 --> 00:08.130
that we need to change on on smaller screens.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.920
So if we take a look the menu looks OK right now.

00:10.920 --> 00:15.150
But if we add more links it's going to start to look funky down here.

00:15.150 --> 00:19.380
I don't like this how this is these are too skinny to be side by side.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.510
Also the text runs off.

00:21.510 --> 00:23.060
These should be stacked as well.

00:23.070 --> 00:28.440
So we basically want to stack everything that's that's being floated on larger screens on the about

00:28.440 --> 00:29.070
page.

00:29.070 --> 00:34.650
We want to stack these we probably want to change the line height for the heading down here.

00:34.650 --> 00:40.500
These are coming out of its container because the height is fixed here and then contact the form looks

00:40.500 --> 00:41.270
good with this.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.300
These should be stack.

00:42.300 --> 00:49.020
So if we have a few things that we need to change or just change on smaller screens now we could put

00:49.020 --> 00:51.710
media queries right in our style dot CSX.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.520
But this this style sheet is already pretty big.

00:54.540 --> 01:03.240
So what I'm going to do is create a whole new style sheet in the CSX folder called Mobile dot CSX and

01:03.240 --> 01:08.790
we're just going to go to our index and right below the style CSX link and we're going to copy that

01:08.790 --> 01:17.340
down we'll change this to mobile and then we just want to add a media attribute and we're going to set

01:17.340 --> 01:26.310
this to screen and and then a set of parentheses and we'll say Max with let's do 768 pixels.

01:26.310 --> 01:33.090
So basically tablets and glass tablets smartphones any any small device and then that's that style sheet

01:33.090 --> 01:33.870
should kick in.

01:34.230 --> 01:42.180
So to test it out in Mobile CSX I'm just going to do a body and do display none which will make the

01:42.180 --> 01:44.790
whole body disappear on small screen.

01:44.790 --> 01:50.520
So I save that you'll see there's nothing showing until I hit that 768 breakpoint.

01:51.040 --> 01:51.310
OK.

01:51.330 --> 01:54.880
So we know that that is actually in effect.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.710
So we'll get rid of that.

01:55.710 --> 02:00.780
I just wanted to test it out now in our index file.

02:00.780 --> 02:06.870
We're going to start with the menu which looks fine now but if I take this last list item the contact

02:06.990 --> 02:11.400
link here and I go go down three more times and save you'll see that.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.970
Now it looks messed up.

02:13.020 --> 02:18.420
So what I want is everything to be centered the logo centered and then all the links to be in a vertical

02:18.420 --> 02:19.080
fashion.

02:19.560 --> 02:26.550
So what I'll do is I'm going to keep our style CSX open and take our mobile CSX and move it over to

02:26.850 --> 02:29.010
this half way over to the right side.

02:29.010 --> 02:32.960
That way we can see both at the same time and see what we need to change.

02:32.970 --> 02:38.520
I'm also going to close up the sidebar here now for the nav bar.

02:38.550 --> 02:39.560
Let's see.

02:39.610 --> 02:47.590
Let's go down to our nav bar and were floating the H1 the logo to the left.

02:47.590 --> 02:50.370
We're floating the well to the right.

02:50.400 --> 03:00.800
We want to basically set those to float none so let's say nav bar H1.

03:01.860 --> 03:09.490
And you know we should be actually targeting the logo class see the H1 has a class of logo so let's

03:09.490 --> 03:11.500
actually do nav bar dot logo.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.650
We'll do that here and over here.

03:14.650 --> 03:19.520
Logo.

03:19.810 --> 03:23.890
And then we're gonna set this to float.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.880
None.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.110
OK.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.300
Just doing that's not going to change anything.

03:27.310 --> 03:32.920
But we want it in the middle so we're gonna say text align center.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.190
And if I save that now that's put in the center.

03:36.190 --> 03:41.890
Now for these I want to first get rid of the float on the well you can see it's floated to the right.

03:41.890 --> 03:45.380
I also want to get rid of the float on the allies.

03:45.490 --> 03:45.720
OK.

03:45.730 --> 03:47.740
So we want to remove both of those

03:50.970 --> 04:03.270
now I could combine both float in my doing so say nav bar you l and let's also do nav bar ally and we

04:03.270 --> 04:08.730
want to set both of them to float none and save

04:11.470 --> 04:14.530
actually know what this.

04:14.820 --> 04:21.030
This is not overwriting this because over here we specified the well so we'll just have to do that here

04:21.030 --> 04:23.940
as well in order for it to overwrite it.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.020
All right.

04:25.080 --> 04:32.910
Now this comes down quite a bit in later on you're probably going to learn Javascript where you can

04:32.910 --> 04:38.280
create some kind of button have and you can click it and then have this menu just kind of transition

04:38.280 --> 04:39.330
down.

04:39.570 --> 04:44.010
We may even get into some of that later on but right now we're just dealing with straight each team

04:44.010 --> 04:44.840
LCROSS.

04:44.850 --> 04:47.280
No animation anything like that.

04:47.280 --> 04:53.100
So I think one thing we could do is get rid of some of the padding not make these so so wide so fat

04:53.550 --> 04:55.350
so it doesn't come down as much.

04:55.380 --> 05:04.650
So let's grab nav bar you well ally a you want to grab the link because that's where the padding is

05:04.650 --> 05:08.130
if we look over here and as padding 20 pixels.

05:08.130 --> 05:13.100
So I'm going to update that to be only five pixels on small screens.

05:13.100 --> 05:13.470
All right.

05:13.470 --> 05:20.550
Now they kind of look bunched together so what I'll do is add a border as well a very faint border so

05:20.550 --> 05:31.190
let's do border bottom and let's do just a shade lighter we'll do four four four.

05:31.260 --> 05:35.560
Let's do dotted as the style in one pixel.

05:35.700 --> 05:35.990
OK.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.990
So we'll save that.

05:37.020 --> 05:39.170
And now that looks much better.

05:39.270 --> 05:41.820
So we still have our hover effect.

05:41.910 --> 05:43.510
Good.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.990
So the next thing I want to do.

05:45.030 --> 05:50.100
Actually let's get rid of those extra links that'll make it look better because it's not there won't

05:50.100 --> 05:51.270
be as many links

05:55.780 --> 05:56.120
OK.

05:56.130 --> 05:58.040
So now we have a responsive menu.

05:58.050 --> 06:03.660
So we have our standard nav bar and then we have our responsive now bar.

06:04.080 --> 06:09.490
So the next thing I want to do is we'll skip the showcase.

06:09.510 --> 06:14.610
When we test what the devices in the dev tools we may need to update this a little bit.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.180
But for now let's move on to the home info section.

06:18.180 --> 06:21.780
And one thing I want to change is the height.

06:21.850 --> 06:27.800
OK if we go down to our home info I.D. it's 400.

06:27.810 --> 06:35.490
I want to actually change it to 450 because it was covering the read more even than when it was a little

06:35.490 --> 06:37.340
bit above 768.

06:37.350 --> 06:40.230
Like right here on 400.

06:40.290 --> 06:44.700
If I change it to 400 you can see that it kind of runs down a little bit.

06:44.700 --> 06:48.070
So we want that to be 450 like that.

06:48.270 --> 06:53.340
And then once we hit that 768 Mark and mobile CSF kicks in.

06:53.490 --> 06:58.800
What I want to do is just get rid of that image completely and have this whole dark part with the tax

06:58.800 --> 07:00.600
go all the way across.

07:00.720 --> 07:08.260
So let's add in here home info and we're going to take the image.

07:08.460 --> 07:16.230
So home dash info and I believe freight here it has a class of info image

07:18.980 --> 07:25.450
and I'm actually going to set that to display none.

07:26.180 --> 07:26.530
All right.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.760
So now that image is gone.

07:28.780 --> 07:34.840
Next thing we need to do is the info content which is this part here we need to get rid of the float

07:35.020 --> 07:36.100
because right now it's float.

07:36.100 --> 07:36.520
Right.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.460
So we need to get rid of the flow.

07:38.470 --> 07:40.150
Actually I'll just copy this whole thing

07:43.470 --> 07:46.050
and we need to change the flow the width and the height.

07:46.790 --> 07:50.010
OK so the float should be none.

07:50.010 --> 07:57.430
And actually the height which the sleeve that put the width we want to change to 100 percent because

07:57.430 --> 07:59.200
we want it to go all the way across.

07:59.230 --> 08:01.400
So let's save that.

08:01.570 --> 08:03.340
And there we go.

08:03.340 --> 08:08.320
All right so you can see that this that these parts are now responsive once we hit that part it goes

08:10.490 --> 08:14.110
down like that OK.

08:14.140 --> 08:18.290
So the next part is the three boxes right here.

08:18.310 --> 08:24.270
Now these have a class of box which are it's the same class it's on these as well so it's also going

08:24.270 --> 08:30.520
to pertain to this basically any anywhere on the site where we want to or we want to line these boxes

08:30.520 --> 08:31.180
up like this.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.030
They have that box class right here.

08:34.030 --> 08:38.500
So we want to clear those and then we want to set them to 100 percent.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.720
That's really all we have to do.

08:40.870 --> 08:47.570
So let's say boxes and Dot box you want to say float none.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.600
And we want to set the width to 100 percent.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.600
OK we'll save that.

08:53.650 --> 08:56.700
And now you can see they're nicely stacked.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.570
So that looks pretty good.

08:58.660 --> 09:01.860
Now we're going to move on to the about page.

09:01.990 --> 09:07.900
This is not going to take effect yet because we haven't added these the link tag to the about page.

09:07.900 --> 09:13.680
So let's go to index and let's copy loops.

09:13.690 --> 09:16.730
Let's just go to this index.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.470
Let me close this up for a second.

09:18.890 --> 09:25.130
So from index I'm going to copy this link to the mobile CSX which has this media attribute and I'm going

09:25.130 --> 09:29.180
to put it in about right under the style CSX and save.

09:29.180 --> 09:31.940
I'm also going to do it with contact.

09:31.940 --> 09:38.750
So on the contact page right below style CSX will paste that in as well that way we have it working

09:38.750 --> 09:41.270
on all pages.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.560
So let's see.

09:42.580 --> 09:46.670
Let's bring back mobile CSX and bring it over to the side

09:49.890 --> 10:00.990
and close it up and we need to clear this float right here because if we look at the style CSX we have

10:00.990 --> 10:03.490
info right which is float right.

10:03.510 --> 10:09.160
We have info left which is float left and they're both 50 percent wide.

10:09.180 --> 10:15.860
So what we need to do is clear are not clear but set float to none for both and set the width to 100

10:15.870 --> 10:17.310
percent for both.

10:17.310 --> 10:22.980
So let's get down here and let's say about and we're going to grab a boat info

10:26.070 --> 10:30.560
info dash right.

10:30.990 --> 10:37.530
And let's also grab a boat info info

10:39.930 --> 10:43.040
dash left.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.640
So we're doing the same thing for both.

10:44.640 --> 10:49.620
So we might as well just just put them both on on the same style.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.010
So let's do float.

10:51.410 --> 10:52.610
None.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.940
And let's do with

10:57.200 --> 11:01.400
100 percent and save.

11:01.550 --> 11:01.830
All right.

11:01.850 --> 11:02.930
Cool.

11:02.960 --> 11:10.760
Now for the heading here I actually want this to be aligned to the center.

11:10.850 --> 11:14.480
So if you remember this has a class of L heading.

11:14.480 --> 11:24.860
So I'm just going to grab that class l dash heading and we're going to text aligned to the center

11:28.270 --> 11:32.130
and then another thing I want to do is the L heading in the style CSX.

11:32.140 --> 11:38.620
I just want to add a line height to because the words we're running into each other so see where as

11:38.630 --> 11:43.620
it should be up here at the utility right here.

11:43.640 --> 11:51.730
So l heading I'm going to say the line height it's change it to one point one point two.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.850
All right now let's see what else do we want to do here.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.690
The info right.

11:58.700 --> 12:02.720
Which is the image I kind of want to move that down a little bit.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.620
I think it's too close right here.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.920
So I'm going to grab this

12:09.480 --> 12:14.640
or go right here and we'll just add a margin top to it.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.920
So it's two 30 pixels.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.670
OK so that move that down a little bit.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.020
All right.

12:22.020 --> 12:28.230
Now the testimonials here you can see that the boxes are kind of coming out a little bit.

12:28.350 --> 12:35.690
So to fix that we should probably actually put that in the style sheet over here.

12:35.850 --> 12:37.830
So let's find testimonials

12:41.670 --> 12:42.200
OK.

12:42.270 --> 12:45.300
So we get height 600 pixels.

12:45.300 --> 12:51.120
What if we just set this to height one hundred percent.

12:51.120 --> 12:51.630
There we go.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.390
So that fixes that we don't even have to add anything special there so that looks pretty good to me.

12:59.620 --> 13:04.690
Now let's go to the contact and notice that these are already stacked because remember these have a

13:04.690 --> 13:07.000
class of box and we've already clear it.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.830
We've already done the float nine we've already done with 100 percent.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.650
One thing that I would like to do though is have a border because I think there's just I don't know

13:14.660 --> 13:17.700
it looks like this too much space in between here.

13:17.800 --> 13:30.400
So let's go down here we'll say contact and let's target the contact dash info and we want to target

13:30.400 --> 13:37.840
the box class inside there not just dot box because we don't want borders on the in the other boxes

13:37.840 --> 13:42.960
which are on the home page you don't need that because as you can see they kind of revolve the colors

13:42.970 --> 13:52.160
so we don't need it there but for the contact boxes let's do border bottom.

13:52.280 --> 14:00.670
It's 2 4 4 4 dotted one pixel and save.

14:00.670 --> 14:06.760
And I can see we have the board I just think it gives it a little just a little texture I guess.

14:07.510 --> 14:07.840
OK.

14:07.870 --> 14:12.150
Cool so what else do we want to do here.

14:12.160 --> 14:16.690
I think we're ready to start testing it on the actual devices so I'm going to make this bigger I'm going

14:16.690 --> 14:25.690
to open up our dev tools and let's click on the device icon here and for this course I'm only going

14:25.690 --> 14:36.010
to be testing on iPhone X 6 7 8 galaxy I don't care about iPhone 5 because the screen size is so small

14:36.010 --> 14:42.580
that we'll have to add extra media queries just for that and not too many people have an iPhone 5 anymore.

14:42.820 --> 14:48.910
If you want to add those add those styles yourself you can do that but we're not going to focus on that.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.140
So let's see if we look at this.

14:52.150 --> 14:55.480
This looks pretty good.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.800
One thing I would I notice though is that this is pushed down quite a bit.

14:58.810 --> 15:04.140
So we may want to look into that about page looks good.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.400
This is pushed down quite a bit.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.330
Contact page looks good.

15:09.330 --> 15:09.630
All right.

15:09.690 --> 15:18.870
Let's look at iPhone 6 7 8 so kind of same thing really looks good.

15:19.550 --> 15:20.100
Let's try.

15:20.120 --> 15:20.990
The Galaxy

15:23.690 --> 15:24.080
Yeah.

15:24.220 --> 15:32.210
Pretty much all the same but if we look at the iPhone 5 you can see that the screen is so small that

15:32.210 --> 15:33.890
it kind of messes up a little bit.

15:35.800 --> 15:40.240
So you might want to just mess with the heights and stuff like that but I'm not I don't want to get

15:40.240 --> 15:42.100
too deep into this.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.300
I just want it to look good on.

15:43.300 --> 15:50.010
On on modern iPhones in the galaxy pixels pixel also looks good.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.260
So let's let's change this right here.

15:53.260 --> 16:00.400
The spacing I'm going to go back into mobile CSX and let's go above or actually let's go right below

16:00.400 --> 16:01.720
where the nav bar is

16:06.250 --> 16:19.810
and let's say showcase and actually showcase and we want the I.D. showcase and I'm going to set the

16:19.810 --> 16:29.790
height to 100 percent case you we have the height at 100 percent now and then I'm going to set the padding

16:29.790 --> 16:35.970
top to 70 pixels and I'm gonna add some padding to the bottom.

16:36.090 --> 16:43.140
Right now the padding is what is the padding on showcase see.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.190
Yeah.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.900
Showcase 0 8.

16:48.270 --> 16:48.470
Yeah.

16:48.470 --> 16:49.830
Padding top.

16:49.830 --> 16:52.110
I'm sorry not showcase showcase content.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.080
The padding top is 170.

16:54.090 --> 16:56.920
So I'm going to change it to 70 which will move it up.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.300
So let's actually just grab this and then we can take these.

17:03.910 --> 17:09.180
So we'll do padding talks 70 and then to add some space on the bottom.

17:09.180 --> 17:13.330
Let's do padding bottom 30 pixels.

17:13.530 --> 17:14.250
And there we go.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.240
That looks much better.

17:17.860 --> 17:18.980
That's the pixel too.

17:18.980 --> 17:27.180
So if you look at the eye I iPhone and let's take a look at the I pad.

17:27.350 --> 17:28.400
That's the I pad

17:33.530 --> 17:41.810
good and the I Pad Pro is just going to look like the desktop because it's so wide OK.

17:41.830 --> 17:47.350
So now what I want to do is check out the landscape view so let's hit the landscape and if you wanted

17:47.350 --> 17:54.670
to you could put a media query for the height and you could you could lessen the padding here but I

17:54.670 --> 17:59.050
think it's fine because as we scroll it looks good you know.

17:59.050 --> 18:04.570
But if you absolutely need to have this above the fold when the when the person lands on the page in

18:04.570 --> 18:07.060
landscape mode you could do that.

18:07.240 --> 18:14.110
But yeah the rest of it you can see the floats are intact because the width is eight twelve hour our

18:14.200 --> 18:16.210
break breakpoint is seven sixty eight.

18:16.210 --> 18:19.650
So these are still going to be floated along with the menu.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.980
If you go to the about you can see we have our floats.

18:23.060 --> 18:23.400
OK.

18:23.470 --> 18:27.190
Everything looks good contact boxes are floated.

18:27.190 --> 18:27.920
Good.

18:27.970 --> 18:30.800
So I think that we're we're in good shape here.

18:30.880 --> 18:36.670
And as I mentioned it's more difficult to make your site responsive when you're using floats floats

18:36.670 --> 18:37.890
are almost like a hack.

18:37.900 --> 18:42.040
They're almost like a CSX hack to to align your elements.

18:42.040 --> 18:47.410
But in the next section we're going to start to look at flex box which is a much much better way to

18:47.410 --> 18:48.580
align things.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.390
You also have CSX grid.

18:50.440 --> 18:55.300
Some people choose like to choose one or the other I think that's silly I think that there's certain

18:55.600 --> 19:00.290
situations for flex in the certain situations for the grid system.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.010
And I'll kind of go over those differences as we move along.

19:05.020 --> 19:05.320
All right.

19:05.320 --> 19:05.830
So that's it.

19:05.830 --> 19:08.580
I hope you're enjoying the course and I'll see you in the next video.
