00:00.380 --> 00:05.940
All right guys in this video I want to just show you how to quickly create a CSX drop down menu.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.520
So we're going to create this right here.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.910
Basically it's just we're focusing on the menu.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.030
And when we hit services you'll see that we get this drop down.

00:15.030 --> 00:15.650
We hit blog.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.430
We get a dropdown we also have this.

00:17.430 --> 00:20.730
This area over here which displays the number of posts.

00:20.890 --> 00:26.160
I figured it was just a nice addition and then we just have a simple showcase here and you could go

00:26.160 --> 00:28.770
on to to add to this if you wanted to.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.970
But the main focus is how to get it.

00:30.980 --> 00:33.750
Show you how to get this dropdown effect.

00:34.050 --> 00:40.240
And I made it semi responsive so you'll see that when we hit a certain point six and our pixels they'll

00:40.360 --> 00:42.750
they'll display block and we hover over it.

00:42.780 --> 00:45.090
We'll get this as the sub menu.

00:45.090 --> 00:45.350
OK.

00:45.360 --> 00:50.060
So it'll basically just push the rest of the links down and show the sub menu here.

00:50.070 --> 00:50.370
All right.

00:50.370 --> 00:51.690
So let's get started.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.540
I just have a folder called dropdown.

00:53.540 --> 01:03.840
I'm going to create an index on each t amount and let's also create a style dot CSX generate our boilerplate

01:03.870 --> 01:13.650
here close that up and let's say CSX drop down menu and let's put in our style sheet

01:16.420 --> 01:20.260
and then we're also gonna use font awesome for these little arrows right here.

01:20.310 --> 01:30.120
So I'm just gonna go to font font awesome dot com start using free and we're going to grab this link

01:30.120 --> 01:30.950
right here.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.460
Paste that in.

01:33.660 --> 01:40.680
So now what we're gonna do is go down to the body and we're going to start to create our each team how

01:40.780 --> 01:42.990
our markup body whatever you want to call it.

01:43.020 --> 01:48.990
So we're gonna have a nav tag and I'm going to give us an idea of Navarre and inside here we'll have

01:48.990 --> 01:56.970
a well we're gonna have an ally with a tag and this will be the home Home Link and I want to copy this

01:56.970 --> 02:01.380
down this one will be about and then the next one is gonna be services.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.180
However this is gonna be the dropdown.

02:04.380 --> 02:09.090
Now I'm not going to have this be a link so I'm going to get rid of the a tag.

02:09.150 --> 02:14.910
I mean you could if you wanted to but I'm just going to have just the text and then we'll have the drop

02:14.910 --> 02:17.340
downs and I'm going to put the icon next to it.

02:17.330 --> 02:25.410
So that's I with a class of F.A. s and then F A Dash angle dash down.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.620
So that'll give us the icon.

02:27.780 --> 02:38.520
And then after that we're gonna put a nested list so another you l and let's do ally and a tag and this

02:38.520 --> 02:44.470
is gonna be web development and we'll just copy this down a couple times.

02:44.610 --> 02:51.960
This next one will be let's say website design and this one here is gonna be mobile development

02:54.630 --> 02:56.630
and then let's do SEO.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.270
OK.

02:59.550 --> 03:03.500
And then the next one is gonna be the blog which is also a dropdown.

03:03.510 --> 03:11.080
So we want to go after this list item after the services and we're gonna say blog.

03:11.370 --> 03:23.490
And again we want our icons so F.A. S F A Dash angle dash down and we're gonna put you all once again

03:25.020 --> 03:32.880
and let's put a list item within a tag and this is gonna be h t email now we're gonna have that that

03:33.450 --> 03:39.900
the post number as well so we're gonna put that in a span so we'll say span twenty two posts.

03:39.900 --> 03:40.220
All right.

03:40.260 --> 03:41.420
I'm going to copy this down.

03:41.420 --> 03:48.480
Let's do that's one two three four five six and we can just change these numbers up to whatever you

03:48.480 --> 03:49.120
want

03:58.590 --> 04:04.740
OK I'll do 21 and let's change these up so we'll do CSX

04:06.570 --> 04:07.830
Javascript

04:10.160 --> 04:17.950
Python on page P. and we'll do one called Design.

04:17.950 --> 04:18.270
OK.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.550
And then after the list item we'll do one more.

04:20.590 --> 04:22.300
And this is just going to be two.

04:22.370 --> 04:26.260
It's gonna be the contact link so contact.

04:26.260 --> 04:26.530
All right.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.970
So that's our menu let's save it.

04:27.970 --> 04:30.690
Let's take a look it's going to look horrible.

04:31.280 --> 04:37.720
So it's just dial and a list an unordered list with some nested unordered lists.

04:37.810 --> 04:42.480
So let's jump into our CSX and let's turn this into this.

04:42.610 --> 04:48.830
So we'll start off with just a general reset of the margin and padding

04:53.260 --> 04:56.580
and let's do box sizing.

04:56.990 --> 05:06.040
Bought a box and then let's do our body and a lot of time just see each team and body like that.

05:06.040 --> 05:14.620
And for this we're gonna have a background let's do a background color of light grey and let's set a

05:14.620 --> 05:18.880
font family let's do aerial

05:21.750 --> 05:23.130
All right.

05:23.310 --> 05:31.080
Now we're gonna work on the nav bar so it's two now bar

05:33.880 --> 05:38.920
the now bar itself isn't going to have anything but we're gonna take the well we're going to do list

05:39.550 --> 05:41.300
style none.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.990
OK make sure there's no bullets.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.080
Then we're going to deal with the list items themselves.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.260
Basically all list items so let's do now.

05:51.260 --> 06:02.860
Bar you well ally and we're gonna set the color to dark grey which if I save it it's only going to affect

06:02.860 --> 06:06.770
the ones that are not linked because we have to color the links separately.

06:06.790 --> 06:16.720
Now we want to display each of these as an inline block OK so if we do that they'll go side by side.

06:16.990 --> 06:21.050
We'll do some padding so we'll save one room of padding.

06:21.190 --> 06:27.780
And we also want to position relative K basically the way that the drop downs are going to work is they're

06:27.790 --> 06:35.590
gonna be positioned absolute inside of this inside of the the the top ally as a container.

06:35.590 --> 06:35.860
OK.

06:35.860 --> 06:42.610
That way we can position it and we can add it so that we can make it so that it comes down on hover.

06:42.610 --> 06:53.440
Now let's color the links so I'm going to just grab this here and say a color will be dark grey and

06:53.440 --> 06:58.600
let's take away the underline so text decoration is going to be none.

06:58.660 --> 06:59.310
OK.

06:59.350 --> 07:06.820
Now we want to we want to hide the nested you ls by default so basically anything that's in a dropdown

07:06.820 --> 07:08.740
we don't want that to show by default.

07:08.770 --> 07:19.030
So let me just put a comment here or say hide hide nested well by default and we can target that by

07:19.030 --> 07:25.650
doing nav bar u l l y you well OK.

07:25.660 --> 07:31.960
Because we're grabbing the unordered lists that are inside the allies and we're gonna set that to display

07:32.290 --> 07:34.090
none and save.

07:34.090 --> 07:37.330
And now those all go away.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.480
All right so let's see.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.460
We'll go ahead and

07:45.860 --> 07:53.300
if I hover over these we get and we get the cursor take changes to a pointer but not on these because

07:53.300 --> 07:54.180
these are not links.

07:54.200 --> 08:08.360
But I want I want a cursor on these women only hover so let's do nav bar you l l I hover and let's do

08:08.390 --> 08:14.700
cursor pointer and I also want the background to be a different color.

08:14.720 --> 08:23.090
So let's do background coral and let's do color whites and save.

08:23.090 --> 08:23.480
OK.

08:23.500 --> 08:29.630
So the color white is not showing on the links but it is on the text because we have no links we have

08:29.630 --> 08:38.270
to target the color separately so let's just take this and say when we hover we also want the links

08:38.750 --> 08:41.370
to have the color of white.

08:41.390 --> 08:47.120
So now when I hover over any of them whether it's actual link or just text we get the white color.

08:47.120 --> 08:54.380
Now when we hover over these here we want the draw we want the nested yells to show.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.570
So let's do that.

08:55.570 --> 08:57.800
Let's say nested

09:01.490 --> 09:03.540
dropdown show.

09:03.590 --> 09:14.770
So we're gonna do nav bar you l l I hover and we want the well inside of that to show.

09:14.780 --> 09:15.390
So remember.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.510
We set it to display none by default.

09:17.510 --> 09:19.790
So now we're gonna set it to display block.

09:20.180 --> 09:25.270
So now if I hover over it we're going to we're going to see it but it's going to it's it's just crazy

09:25.280 --> 09:26.780
so we're gonna fix this up.

09:27.530 --> 09:36.280
Let's go ahead and let's do a position of absolute.

09:38.270 --> 09:42.630
And we're going to we're going to say from the left zero.

09:43.040 --> 09:49.520
And let's set a width to be 200 pixels and if you guys want to mess with this a little bit you can.

09:49.520 --> 09:55.340
And then I'm gonna do a margin top of one room all right.

09:55.370 --> 09:57.190
So we check it out.

09:57.190 --> 10:02.150
You can see that at least it's positioned underneath.

10:02.150 --> 10:04.610
It's going to be 200 pixels wide.

10:04.610 --> 10:08.330
There's no background though so let's target each list item

10:11.800 --> 10:17.990
I'm going to grab this right here we just did and we're gonna target the list item on hover and we're

10:17.990 --> 10:20.780
gonna say display block

10:23.560 --> 10:31.720
and we're gonna add a background and let's to e we'll do e seven three times.

10:31.720 --> 10:36.320
And now if we hover you can see that it has the background however the lengths are white still so we

10:36.320 --> 10:40.450
want to target the tag when we hover.

10:40.480 --> 10:46.500
So it's to ally a and let's set the color to 3 3 3.

10:46.570 --> 10:49.060
So now the links are dark.

10:49.150 --> 10:53.500
Now we also want a hover a color for these if we hover over that.

10:54.610 --> 11:02.160
So we'll have to do see we'll have to do this.

11:02.410 --> 11:11.950
So when we hover over the top ally we want we're going to target the hover of the nested allies like

11:11.950 --> 11:15.610
that and let's do a background

11:18.310 --> 11:26.980
and we're gonna do e 0 3 times and make sure the color.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.060
Well we shouldn't have to do that.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.950
Well we could do two color inherit

11:33.920 --> 11:34.280
all right.

11:34.310 --> 11:35.840
So we'll save.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.270
And now we have that lighter color.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.710
I'm sorry a darker color.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.110
When we hover over these.

11:42.110 --> 11:42.370
All right.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.820
So that's starting to shape up.

11:43.850 --> 11:50.930
Now let's deal with the spans these 22 these posts right here we want these to have a coral background.

11:50.930 --> 11:54.390
I also want the color to change for those when they're hovered over.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.930
So let's target this.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.640
The span remember we put those in a span.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.970
So we want this now.

12:00.980 --> 12:06.160
Bar you al ally hover you al ally in the span.

12:06.290 --> 12:15.290
So like that and we'll say span we want that to actually float to the right and we're going to make

12:15.290 --> 12:23.690
the color white in the background coral.

12:24.430 --> 12:24.720
OK.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.270
We're going to add a little bit of padding.

12:26.270 --> 12:32.130
We'll do zero point two REM top and bottom zero point five REM left and right.

12:33.050 --> 12:42.910
Let's text align to the center and let's make the font size a little smaller we'll do zero point eight

12:43.300 --> 12:46.480
RAM and let's round the corners a little bit.

12:46.480 --> 12:51.150
So border radius and we'll do five pixels.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.450
OK so let's save that.

12:52.450 --> 12:53.020
Take a look.

12:53.020 --> 12:57.100
Good.

12:57.250 --> 13:01.150
And I think that's what I also want them to change color a little bit.

13:01.150 --> 13:06.430
So let's let's grab this.

13:06.430 --> 13:12.470
But let's say on the list item hover OK so the inner list item hover.

13:12.490 --> 13:16.410
We want the span background to change too.

13:16.420 --> 13:20.230
Let's do chocolate which is pretty close to coral.

13:20.230 --> 13:25.030
So as we hover over it now you can see the background of those change.

13:25.030 --> 13:25.320
All right.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.350
So it's pretty good.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.820
Now what I'm going to do and if you want to add a background to the now bar you can do that as well.

13:32.950 --> 13:36.220
But I'm going to add our showcase area right underneath.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.990
So did I already add it.

13:37.990 --> 13:38.560
No I didn't.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.830
So in the aged here now it's going to be very simple.

13:41.840 --> 13:51.670
I'm just going to go under the NAV input a let's do a header showcase and all I'm going to put in here

13:51.670 --> 14:03.790
is an H one and just say your Web site here and we'll go back to our style sheet and let's grab on to

14:03.790 --> 14:04.990
the showcase

14:10.150 --> 14:17.430
and let's set up actually knowing what we're gonna do is I'm going to display this as a flex column.

14:17.430 --> 14:26.500
So display flex flex direction is gonna be column and for the height I'm just gonna do three hundred

14:26.500 --> 14:36.250
pixels and then let's align everything that at the center so we'll say a line items center justify content

14:36.250 --> 14:51.420
center text align center and let's do padding zero and two to ram on the left and right.

14:51.830 --> 14:54.920
Let's go ahead semicolon there.

14:54.940 --> 14:55.210
All right.

14:55.230 --> 14:56.230
So we'll save that.

14:56.620 --> 14:57.880
Oh I didn't add the background

15:01.020 --> 15:06.930
so let's add background coral

15:09.610 --> 15:09.870
all right.

15:09.870 --> 15:10.450
Actually you know what.

15:10.470 --> 15:14.610
Let's put the let's put that in there in a variable the color.

15:14.610 --> 15:22.520
So we'll say for the root scope let's do primary color.

15:22.680 --> 15:33.030
There's gonna be coral and then we'll just change this to var dash dash primary color.

15:33.030 --> 15:37.250
Grab that and go down here.

15:37.260 --> 15:44.160
Place that that way it's easy to change the color and then we could use this as a secondary color

15:48.660 --> 15:54.380
so up here we'll say a secondary color

15:56.860 --> 15:57.370
chocolate

16:01.130 --> 16:01.550
all right.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.610
And then for the H one in the showcase

16:08.180 --> 16:14.940
let's make it color white and let's make the font size.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.350
Let's do four REM.

16:18.350 --> 16:20.510
Here we go.

16:20.510 --> 16:24.550
So I have the showcase matching the hover state which I like.

16:24.560 --> 16:29.810
I like that in fact and if you're on a certain page you can do like a current current class and have

16:29.810 --> 16:30.500
it like that.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.980
So it actually looks like it's kind of part of the showcase.

16:33.980 --> 16:34.270
All right.

16:34.280 --> 16:40.190
So let's let's deal with the responsiveness because right now if we go like right here it's I mean it

16:40.190 --> 16:48.770
goes off the screen so I'm just gonna do a quick solution for this and let's add a media query with

16:48.770 --> 17:00.080
a max width of 600 pixels and we're just going to take the nav bar you all ally and instead of displaying

17:00.080 --> 17:02.240
inline block we're gonna display block.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.880
That way they go on top of each other.

17:04.450 --> 17:04.730
All right.

17:05.690 --> 17:14.180
And then let's see we're going to take the the nested well on hover and we're going to set it to a width

17:14.180 --> 17:16.880
of one hundred percent and also position it relative.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.760
Right now it's two hundred pixels wide and it's position absolute which means it just goes over the

17:22.760 --> 17:25.820
rest of the content and we can't see the rest of the menu items.

17:25.820 --> 17:28.960
I want it to basically just push everything down.

17:29.060 --> 17:34.730
So we're gonna say nav bar you al ally hover somewhere hover over it.

17:34.730 --> 17:44.420
We want the well to have a with of 100 percent and we want the position to go from absolute to relative.

17:44.420 --> 17:44.720
OK.

17:44.750 --> 17:45.560
We'll save that.

17:45.590 --> 17:51.770
And now when we hover over it we get all of our sub items and we can still go to the next one we can

17:51.770 --> 17:54.170
see all the menu items still.

17:54.170 --> 17:54.470
OK.

17:54.470 --> 18:00.920
So I mean it's not really the best looking thing in the world but it is a solution for you know if you're

18:01.220 --> 18:03.060
for smaller screens.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.090
But yeah.

18:04.100 --> 18:10.160
That's gonna be a guys a lot of these dropdown menus will involve javascript but I'm trying not to get

18:10.160 --> 18:15.020
into too much javascript cause I don't want it because I want to focus on each team LCROSS and how you

18:15.020 --> 18:21.530
can do things with just those in it and I've mentioned it before that I do have a modern javascript

18:21.530 --> 18:26.960
from the beginning course on you to me as well but that's it hopefully you enjoy this little project

18:26.960 --> 18:32.780
it's just something that I thought of that I think should be included in the course is how to create

18:32.780 --> 18:34.480
these little drop downs.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.760
And of course as there's many other ways to do it.

18:36.770 --> 18:41.120
But this is one and I think it's pretty pretty easy but that's it.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.220
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
