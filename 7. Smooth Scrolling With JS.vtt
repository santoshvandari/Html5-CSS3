WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:00.750
All right guys.

00:00.750 --> 00:06.900
Now we're going to implement our smooth rolling and we're going to have to use javascript with J query

00:07.220 --> 00:13.470
and I'll explain a little bit about that in a minute but I just want to show you guys something I opened

00:13.470 --> 00:22.560
the site in Safari and with Safari the the position Sticky isn't doesn't work just yet.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.850
So the menu isn't isn't sticking to the top which is fine.

00:26.850 --> 00:29.720
It's not like it breaks or anything it just simply doesn't stick.

00:29.750 --> 00:38.010
But one thing I noticed is the spacing right here and to fix that we actually want to go to want to

00:38.010 --> 00:45.480
go to our style CSX and go to our showcase content and where I have top we actually want to change this

00:45.480 --> 00:49.070
to 65 which I put in the beginning but it wasn't.

00:49.070 --> 00:53.490
It was showing extra space down here because I forgot the bottom zero.

00:53.910 --> 00:57.720
So let's go ahead and save that and notice it still looks fine here.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.750
Everything is good and if I bring safari back in now we don't have that spacing.

01:02.850 --> 01:04.000
OK.

01:04.260 --> 01:07.790
And this you know it still works but it just doesn't stick to the top.

01:07.830 --> 01:14.750
So it's I mean it doesn't hurt to use position stick even though it's not supported in some browsers.

01:15.140 --> 01:21.300
It just makes a better experience if you're in Chrome or Firefox or browsers that do support it.

01:21.780 --> 01:22.140
OK.

01:22.560 --> 01:27.270
So now let's start let's get into the smooth scrolling now to use J.

01:27.260 --> 01:27.960
Query.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.370
Let's go to J.

01:31.370 --> 01:34.380
Query dot com.

01:34.410 --> 01:35.020
Now J.

01:35.040 --> 01:41.400
Query was used all the time years a couple of years ago and it's starting to phase out for things like

01:41.850 --> 01:47.910
dumb Dom selection basically selecting things from the document object model which is basically the

01:47.910 --> 01:53.560
hierarchy of each time all tags and attributes and content in the browser.

01:53.580 --> 01:59.340
Now you can do all this stuff with vanilla javascript which is just regular javascript so there's a

01:59.340 --> 02:02.310
lot of things you don't need a query for that you used to.

02:02.310 --> 02:09.720
However animation is one that is kind of difficult to do and in some situations.

02:09.720 --> 02:15.470
So things like Sly sliders and scrolling effects and stuff J.

02:15.540 --> 02:17.460
Query makes this stuff really easy.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.010
So we're gonna be using it for this.

02:20.010 --> 02:23.630
This one feature now you could download the javascript.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.510
It's just basically a javascript file you could download it.

02:26.520 --> 02:31.200
We're going to use what's called a C D N which we've actually been using with font.

02:31.230 --> 02:32.220
Awesome.

02:32.220 --> 02:38.850
If you look in our index each team I'll file our font awesome CSX is coming from somewhere else right.

02:38.850 --> 02:42.510
It's not it's not located in our local file here.

02:42.570 --> 02:46.230
It's coming from this huge dot font awesome dot com.

02:46.290 --> 02:49.860
So we're going to do the same type of thing with J query.

02:50.130 --> 02:55.590
So I just need to find where we can get the C.D. in here right here using J.

02:55.590 --> 03:00.140
Query with a C.D. And then it stands for content delivery network.

03:00.270 --> 03:03.180
So let's go

03:06.150 --> 03:07.260
Jake right here.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.840
So Jake Query CDM provided by stack path.

03:10.870 --> 03:13.950
No that's not it.

03:14.030 --> 03:17.060
You know I can't find it is because.

03:17.110 --> 03:17.390
OK.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.760
So that's the fire.

03:18.780 --> 03:24.710
I usually just type in J query C.D. And yeah.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.250
So right here code dot J.

03:26.250 --> 03:31.130
Cary dot com and then there's different versions we're gonna choose the latest which is J.

03:31.170 --> 03:37.560
Query three and one thing you don't want to do is choose the slim version the reason for that is with

03:37.560 --> 03:43.590
the smooth scrolling we're actually using the intimate function or the intimate method and that's not

03:43.590 --> 03:49.440
included in the slim version so you can choose the uncompressed which is just the regular JavaScript

03:49.440 --> 03:55.650
file are minute offside which means that all the whitespace is removed all the comments things like

03:55.650 --> 04:00.680
that and it makes your file a little makes it a little faster because it's smaller.

04:00.870 --> 04:06.710
So we'll go ahead and choose the minute fied and then it's gonna give us a script tag that has the J

04:06.720 --> 04:07.640
Cary CDM.

04:07.700 --> 04:13.800
So we can copy this we're actually can just click this that you copy it to your clipboard and then we'll

04:13.800 --> 04:22.470
go back into our index file go down to the bottom and we're gonna pace this in above our main J Yes.

04:22.490 --> 04:34.800
In fact I'm going to put a comment here and say this is our local J.S. file and this is Google Maps

04:35.490 --> 04:44.150
and then above the local we're gonna put our J query C.D. in.

04:44.460 --> 04:48.800
So we're just including the J query JavaScript file from somewhere else.

04:48.810 --> 04:52.650
Now it's important to put it above the main J S because we're using J.

04:52.650 --> 04:56.650
Query inside of this javascript file if we put this below it.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.840
It's not going to know what we're talking about.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.210
OK.

04:59.220 --> 05:02.280
So it's it's important to use this order.

05:02.460 --> 05:10.080
Now we did use Google Maps inside the main J Yes but notice that in the script tag that Google gave

05:10.080 --> 05:12.080
us they use async defer.

05:12.420 --> 05:17.930
So that makes it so that we can actually put it down here and we can still use it in this manger.

05:17.930 --> 05:18.800
Yes.

05:18.930 --> 05:26.620
So let's save this and let's go into our main J.S. and I'm going to just pace this in

05:29.830 --> 05:32.950
and this is our little code snippet for smooth scrolling.

05:32.950 --> 05:39.750
So basically we're targeting the nav bar any link that's inside the nav bar.

05:40.030 --> 05:41.910
Because if we look at our code here.

05:41.930 --> 05:44.940
All right I'm sorry our markup our HD.

05:45.190 --> 05:51.390
We have our whereas it's I.D. nav bar and we're targeting the link k.

05:51.410 --> 05:53.710
So if any link is clicked.

05:53.710 --> 05:58.300
So we're saying on click which is an event then we run a function.

05:58.450 --> 05:58.900
OK.

05:58.900 --> 06:06.340
Now this function we're checking for the hash because when we click this we're basically looking at

06:06.340 --> 06:10.180
these the hash and then whatever the ideas.

06:10.180 --> 06:17.830
And then we're gonna call the animate on the body on the H team Allen body and we want to scroll from

06:17.830 --> 06:20.290
the top to that hash.

06:20.290 --> 06:21.360
OK.

06:21.400 --> 06:27.100
I mean you don't need to understand all this but that's what it's doing it's going to basically do a

06:27.100 --> 06:31.150
smooth scroll and this is the speed at which it's going to do it.

06:31.170 --> 06:39.490
So you can you can make this faster or slower it's in milliseconds so a hundred milliseconds and then

06:39.490 --> 06:41.800
we also want to do it with the class of button.

06:41.800 --> 06:47.340
And the reason I put that there is because if we look at the Showcase we have the read more.

06:47.350 --> 06:48.990
And it goes to the what.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.470
And it has a class of button.

06:50.470 --> 06:53.890
So if we click that I also want that smooth scrolling implemented.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.740
So I'm going to go ahead and save this.

06:56.740 --> 07:00.520
Our main JSA is already being included so it should work.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.920
So we'll go back here and say what.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.660
And it's scroll this down.

07:05.790 --> 07:12.690
And the reason that it's not covering the the title anymore is because I put this in here I basically

07:12.690 --> 07:20.610
said you know we want to scroll down to the I.D. And we want to minus one.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.320
If I don't have this here

07:25.570 --> 07:32.930
so if we do that and we say what you can see it's still covering I go to who is still covering it.

07:32.960 --> 07:38.540
So adding that negative 100 pixels that fixed it.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.670
So now we can actually see the titles.

07:41.740 --> 07:42.080
OK.

07:42.110 --> 07:47.600
So I mean like I said don't worry if that doesn't make sense it's absolutely fine.

07:47.600 --> 07:55.820
I want to add one more snippet of JavaScript so that when we start to scroll this nav bar has a little

07:55.820 --> 08:02.720
bit of opacity a little bit of transparency so we can see through it right now it's completely solid

08:03.020 --> 08:07.840
but I only want to do it when we're not one more so when we scroll down from the top.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.400
So let me just add that in real quick.

08:10.430 --> 08:18.530
So in Maine dot J.S. put that right here and basically this isn't J J query.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.720
This is just regular javascript.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.160
Adding an event to the window.

08:23.160 --> 08:23.430
OK.

08:23.450 --> 08:29.330
So in our in JavaScript you have a window object which is the whole browser and we're listening for

08:29.330 --> 08:36.050
a scroll and we're saying if the scroll y position is greater than 150 basically if we're scroll down

08:36.050 --> 08:42.800
more than one and 150 we're going to select the nav bar and we're going to set the opacity to zero point

08:42.800 --> 08:45.350
nine which will give it a slight transparency.

08:45.350 --> 08:48.110
Else if we're less than 150.

08:48.110 --> 08:51.810
So basically if it's up at the top then the opacity will be 1.

08:51.950 --> 08:56.210
It's not going to be and it's not going to be transparent at all.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.290
So let's save that and notice it's not transparent.

08:59.300 --> 09:06.060
But as soon as I go more than 150 down which is right you'll see it kick in right here.

09:06.080 --> 09:06.500
See how.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.020
Now you can see through it.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.620
If I go up you can't.

09:09.620 --> 09:14.000
That's because we're hitting that 150 position.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.590
And now as we scroll down we can see through it.

09:17.670 --> 09:23.690
So as you can see you can do some really cool things with JavaScript and even J query but we're not

09:23.690 --> 09:25.030
going to get into that.

09:25.040 --> 09:31.110
This course is about H2 on CSX but that's definitely the direction you want to go after this.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.890
But let's let's check it out in Safari while we're at it.

09:33.890 --> 09:40.560
So let me just grab the URL here and yes.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.850
So it's just going to be you know stuck to the top which is fine.

09:45.190 --> 09:48.160
And then another thing I want to do is just get rid of the space and edge ledger.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.450
That should all be one word.

09:49.450 --> 09:56.730
So in the logo let's see we have edge here is this.

09:56.740 --> 10:00.400
Think the space is right here.

10:00.550 --> 10:01.420
Save that.

10:01.420 --> 10:01.890
And yeah.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.070
Now it's all one word.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.200
OK.

10:04.210 --> 10:08.180
So I believe that the just the regular sight is complete.

10:08.200 --> 10:13.570
So all we have to do now is the responsiveness which we have to deal with the menu because if we go

10:13.570 --> 10:17.110
to small you can see it can kind of mess up.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.380
I just want the logo on top.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.780
Have this centered.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.080
And this.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.550
We want these to stack.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.920
We want this.

10:25.990 --> 10:32.800
We want to get rid of the image and just have this clients I want these images to be a little bigger.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.020
We're also going to get rid of the last one so there's only four.

10:36.040 --> 10:40.170
And then we're going to put the map on the bottom of the contact.

10:40.270 --> 10:46.930
Also on wide screens I want the icon here to float or not float but we're going to use flex blocks.

10:46.930 --> 10:51.710
I want it to be aligned to the left as opposed to just being in the middle always.

10:51.730 --> 10:52.490
OK.

10:52.510 --> 10:55.550
Also on tablets if it's like this size I want it to.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.060
I want it to stack.

10:58.060 --> 11:04.570
So that's all stuff that will have to do with the mobile dot CSX and the wide screen dots CSX.

11:04.570 --> 11:04.810
OK.

11:04.840 --> 11:11.480
So hopefully you guys are enjoying this and you're able to follow along and things are making sense.

11:11.590 --> 11:13.330
If a couple things don't.

11:13.330 --> 11:14.220
Don't worry about it.

11:14.230 --> 11:17.560
I mean it happens we're not going to understand every single thing.

11:17.710 --> 11:18.850
The first time around.

11:18.850 --> 11:25.360
So you know it'll it'll come to you in whether it's in this course in the future and in future projects

11:25.360 --> 11:31.150
and in sections or just creating your own projects and so on.

11:31.150 --> 11:31.410
All right.

11:31.420 --> 11:31.990
So that's it.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.270
I'll see you in the next video.
