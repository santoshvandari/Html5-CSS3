WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:03.330
All right guys so we have all of our pages done.

00:03.330 --> 00:09.840
Now we're gonna start to look at responsiveness and making it look better on smaller screen so I'm going

00:09.840 --> 00:12.360
to actually create a new SAS file.

00:12.360 --> 00:19.470
So in SPSS I'm going to create a file called underscore media dot SPSS and this is where I want to put

00:19.470 --> 00:20.400
my media queries.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.760
Now I want to bring this into the main CSX our SPSS but I'm going to bring it in down at the bottom

00:26.790 --> 00:29.620
because that's where I want this stuff to be included.

00:29.640 --> 00:35.420
So at the very bottom here let's do import media.

00:37.800 --> 00:44.280
So we'll just put a comment here or say import media queries.

00:44.780 --> 00:45.060
OK.

00:45.090 --> 00:55.070
So let's head over to media SPSS and let's start off with tablets and smaller.

00:55.090 --> 00:55.320
OK.

00:55.380 --> 00:59.090
So I'm going to put a media query for a max width of 800 pixels here.

00:59.160 --> 01:09.450
So let's do at media and let's say Max with it's going to be eight hundred pixels

01:11.880 --> 01:15.490
and let's start with the header home.

01:15.630 --> 01:21.040
So let's do I.D. had our dash home.

01:21.270 --> 01:23.060
We're actually not going to have very much in here.

01:23.070 --> 01:31.500
But what I want to do is make the height much less than what it is on on laptops and desktops so I'm

01:31.500 --> 01:38.010
going to take the height from 100 viewport with our viewport height to just 30 REM which is still pretty

01:38.010 --> 01:38.370
big.

01:38.370 --> 01:44.120
It should take a good chunk of the screen but we don't want it to cover the whole screen on a tablet.

01:44.370 --> 01:47.190
And then I'm just gonna take the header content

01:52.080 --> 01:59.940
and actually you know what we can nest this within header home.

01:59.940 --> 02:06.400
So we're going to take the header content and just add a padding dash top of five.

02:07.530 --> 02:08.940
So let's take a look at that.

02:08.940 --> 02:16.410
Now if if this doesn't show like if the media query styles do not show just go ahead and restart this

02:16.410 --> 02:24.020
down here with control C and then run NPM run SAS again you might have to just receive media SPSS.

02:24.340 --> 02:24.730
OK.

02:24.750 --> 02:30.810
And then let's go back here and let's make this smaller and once we hit eight hundred you can see that

02:31.560 --> 02:36.540
it then goes down to the width of that sorry the height goes down to 30 REM.

02:37.420 --> 02:37.680
OK.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.300
So I think that that's better on a tablet rather than having it take up the whole screen.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.570
So that's pretty much it for the 800 pix media pixels media query.

02:48.570 --> 02:55.200
Now I want to deal with smartphones so anything that's under 500 because right here I mean things look

02:55.200 --> 02:56.890
pretty decent.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.450
We don't really need to do anything else for this size.

02:59.520 --> 03:04.650
So we want to now deal with you know smaller Actually what we'll do is open up

03:07.620 --> 03:12.140
chrome tools and let's set it to iPhone X.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.160
OK.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.840
So there's a few things you want to do here.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.490
Under the media max width of 800 pixels.

03:22.500 --> 03:36.780
Let's do smartphones and we're going to do media Max with and let's do this let's say five hundred pixels.

03:37.100 --> 03:37.360
OK.

03:37.380 --> 03:42.610
So first I'm going to work on the header and the main NAV.

03:42.690 --> 03:50.790
Now the main nav I'm going to set the Flex direction instead of roll I'm going to set it to column I

03:50.790 --> 03:58.350
actually want the the logo on top in the center and then the menu underneath in the center.

03:58.350 --> 04:07.990
So let's take the main NAV and let's set the Flex direction to column.

04:08.400 --> 04:19.170
And I want to line items center and I also want the list items I'm going to embed our nest the list

04:19.170 --> 04:20.110
items here.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.260
I'm going to set padding too.

04:23.310 --> 04:25.410
Let's do one REM

04:30.210 --> 04:30.450
OK.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.680
So now you can see that it's in a column fashion rather than a row.

04:34.680 --> 04:41.490
So we have the the logo in the middle on top and then we have the menu in the middle here.

04:41.580 --> 04:46.290
So let's deal with the rest of the header because this obviously doesn't look very good.

04:46.440 --> 04:57.680
So we're going to go under the main NAV and let's do header and we're going to do Amber Sam Dash home.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.620
OK.

04:58.740 --> 05:04.110
And the reason I'm doing it like this is because we're also going to add some styles for Dash inner

05:04.110 --> 05:04.670
as well.

05:04.680 --> 05:10.560
Notice up here I just put in header dash home because we weren't we don't have any styles up here for

05:11.400 --> 05:13.060
header dash inter.

05:13.210 --> 05:19.890
OK so I mean you can do it if you want and header dash home header dash or you don't have to do it this

05:19.890 --> 05:20.180
way.

05:20.190 --> 05:22.880
I just like to organize it in this way.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.650
But you know everyone's different.

05:25.650 --> 05:30.500
So I'm going to set the height to be much smaller.

05:30.530 --> 05:35.890
So on tablets it's 30 ram on full screen it's 100.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.330
It takes up the whole thing on smartphones.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.880
I'm just going to do 10 Ram.

05:41.680 --> 05:46.770
OK so if we save that we take a look you can see that it's much smaller.

05:46.770 --> 05:53.160
Now I'm also going to add a border on the bottom here to kind of separate the rest of the content.

05:53.160 --> 06:03.060
So it's two border bottom and let's set that to three pixels solid and we want it set to the main color

06:03.780 --> 06:05.040
variable.

06:05.040 --> 06:05.400
All right.

06:05.400 --> 06:12.780
Now I don't want the header content displayed all we want is the the logo and the menu and it's not

06:12.780 --> 06:17.510
shown here just because well it is actually we have that you can see the button here.

06:17.580 --> 06:20.730
So we want to just we don't want to show that at all.

06:20.730 --> 06:26.070
So I'm going to invest in here the header content

06:29.390 --> 06:34.040
and let's just set this to display none.

06:35.340 --> 06:35.610
OK.

06:35.630 --> 06:40.310
So now if we go back you'll see that none of that contents displayed that button's gone and we just

06:40.310 --> 06:44.530
have a very simple header with a logo and a menu.

06:44.600 --> 06:49.950
Now the inter pages we take a look here you'll see that the menu is is covered.

06:50.360 --> 06:58.030
So we want the same height for the inner add that we do for the home menu or the home header.

06:58.030 --> 07:09.200
So let's go back in here and let's go after home and let's say inner and let's also set the height to

07:09.200 --> 07:10.620
10 room.

07:11.030 --> 07:16.610
And then if we go back and you'll see the inner pages now are the same as the home actually you know

07:16.610 --> 07:20.640
what we want to do though see how the home the positioning is different.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.360
We want to set the positioning of the home to the same.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.350
To the same x and y values as the inner.

07:28.370 --> 07:41.990
So right here in the home what's two background dash position which if we look in main dot SPSS is right

07:41.990 --> 07:42.740
here.

07:42.740 --> 07:45.200
So 20 percent 30 percent.

07:45.790 --> 07:46.090
OK.

07:46.100 --> 07:52.140
So we want to set that to 20 percent 30 percent.

07:52.140 --> 07:58.010
And now if we save that you'll see that now it looks the same on all pages.

07:58.010 --> 07:58.360
OK.

07:58.370 --> 08:02.320
So let's start to work on stacking some of this stuff.

08:02.330 --> 08:05.530
So we'll start with the home page.

08:05.750 --> 08:12.950
We'll just have basically one style for everything we want stacked so anything that has a grid template

08:12.960 --> 08:17.840
columns of you know repeat for one FDR or repeat three 1 to fire.

08:17.840 --> 08:24.320
We just want to set it to 1 at 5 1 fraction which is just one column that will make it stacked.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.000
So I'm going to go.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.000
Let's see.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.150
Let's go under.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.550
We want to be within the media query.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.220
So this media query ends here.

08:34.220 --> 08:41.470
So I'm going to go right here and let's say stack we want this to be a comment.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.220
So stack grid columns.

08:45.260 --> 08:53.890
So first thing is let's do home dash a specials OK which is a grid.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.560
Next we want home B.

08:56.960 --> 09:02.730
So home dash B stats stats.

09:03.150 --> 09:07.710
And let's do home dash see process.

09:08.180 --> 09:13.650
So these are all grids and then on the about page we have our testimonials.

09:13.670 --> 09:20.720
So let's do a boat dash D class of testimonials.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.230
And then we also have our items on our work page.

09:24.350 --> 09:25.880
So let's say items

09:29.290 --> 09:37.990
so within here I'm just going to set the grid template columns simply to one fraction.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.420
So if I save that we go back.

09:40.420 --> 09:43.090
You can see that these are all stacked.

09:43.160 --> 09:49.720
OK the three sections on the home page will deal with the footer and a little bit and then on the about

09:49.720 --> 09:54.730
page the testimonials are stacked.

09:54.970 --> 10:03.610
We're going to deal with this and then let's see on the work page these are all stacked.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.980
So let's see what else you want to do here.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.680
I want to add.

10:10.300 --> 10:17.020
And the reason that this doesn't look good is because remember we used grid template areas here so we

10:17.020 --> 10:23.620
have to we have to manage this in a different way to make it responsive same with the contact.

10:23.620 --> 10:31.390
But before we do that I want to make this look a little bit better by taking like these boxes here and

10:31.390 --> 10:36.840
putting a little border underneath each one because they're kind of running into each other here.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.810
So let's do that.

10:38.950 --> 10:53.260
Let's go back in and let's go under here and let's do home and let's do Ampersand dash a and we want

10:53.260 --> 11:03.350
to grab the specials div so each div inside the specials class I'm going to add a border bottom two.

11:03.380 --> 11:11.550
Let's do one pixel I'm going to use the light color I want it to be pretty faint and solid.

11:11.810 --> 11:14.250
Let's add a little bit of padding to push each one down.

11:14.260 --> 11:20.920
So padding bottom I'm going to set to one room and I don't want the very last one to have a border so

11:20.920 --> 11:30.500
I'm going to add in here Ampersand colon last child and let's set the border to none.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.300
UPS border none.

11:33.480 --> 11:39.460
And let's set the padding bottom to 0 on the last one.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.360
So we save that.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.490
We take a look.

11:41.590 --> 11:46.350
Now you can see it has a very faint border after each one except for the bottom.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.140
We don't need a border here that would look kind of weird.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.110
Now let's see what else do we want to do.

11:53.110 --> 12:01.070
Here are the stats which are these here I want to just lessen the padding a little bit.

12:01.070 --> 12:08.900
So within this a right here I'm going to go outside of specials but within the a I'm sorry not within

12:08.900 --> 12:10.490
the eights it's Section B.

12:10.490 --> 12:23.820
So we want to go after the A C dash B and we're gonna take the stats divs and set the padding to let's

12:23.820 --> 12:36.560
do two REM top zero and then one Ram bottom OK so that lessens the padding a little bit.

12:36.930 --> 12:40.760
Now I think that that's good for the.

12:40.770 --> 12:42.070
The home page.

12:42.150 --> 12:46.110
I think that we should handle the footer though before we move on because this obviously doesn't look

12:46.110 --> 12:47.610
very good.

12:47.700 --> 12:53.220
So let's go back in and let's go.

12:53.410 --> 12:55.090
Still within the media query.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.250
So we want to go right here.

12:57.280 --> 13:04.630
Let's say footer and we have an I.D. of main dash footer.

13:04.630 --> 13:12.160
I'm going to set the height of the footer to seven RAM and then I'm going to grab the footer content

13:14.440 --> 13:16.710
and set the Flex direction to column.

13:16.720 --> 13:22.900
So we're kind of doing the same thing that we did with the nav bar set it to column and then we're going

13:22.900 --> 13:30.820
to set padding to one room and let's set the height of that to 5 room and let's see what that looks

13:30.820 --> 13:32.640
like.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.370
OK.

13:33.460 --> 13:39.700
So instead of having it in a flex row going across now they're in a column and we just added some padding

13:39.700 --> 13:42.220
to kind of separate this stuff a little bit.

13:42.220 --> 13:45.620
So I think that that looks pretty good.

13:45.670 --> 13:46.080
Let's see.

13:46.080 --> 13:51.160
Next thing we want to do is let's do the about page.

13:51.160 --> 13:55.630
So we'll handle this part right here which is which our grid template areas.

13:55.630 --> 13:59.410
So we just want to basically reframe the grid template areas.

13:59.410 --> 14:09.430
So I want to go here and say about let me just put a comment right here as well for home.

14:09.830 --> 14:15.170
So we'll say idea about and we want to deal with about Dash a.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.600
So let's do Ampersand dash a.

14:19.190 --> 14:23.260
And it has a class of intro right.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.080
Wait what was it.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.280
I mean just check this out.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.970
So hey and we want the grid which is this.

14:31.970 --> 14:41.930
Oh it's about info not intro so class about Dash info which is already displayed as a grid and it has

14:41.930 --> 14:45.350
template areas which sets the columns.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.970
Now I just want it to be stacked.

14:46.970 --> 14:53.850
So I'm going to take the bio image and just to show you what I'm talking about.

14:53.850 --> 14:58.630
If we look at about let's see where is it.

14:58.770 --> 15:05.010
So right here we have bio image bio bio basically want all of these just to go straight down in one

15:05.700 --> 15:07.950
one column or one row.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.140
So let's say bio image

15:13.450 --> 15:13.870
Wait a minute.

15:13.870 --> 15:14.530
This isn't right.

15:14.530 --> 15:20.500
We have to add in grid template areas and then we're going to do

15:23.130 --> 15:30.900
bio image next line here will be bio then we have award one

15:33.450 --> 15:37.990
award too and award three.

15:38.050 --> 15:43.550
And we already have the grid template the other grid areas set right here.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.500
So we don't have to redo those or anything it's already set.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.440
We just simply want to change the orientation.

15:49.440 --> 15:49.860
All right.

15:49.860 --> 15:58.790
And then for SI let's see this right here.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.070
This is see the logos.

16:01.070 --> 16:06.830
I'm just going to remove this whole thing because I don't it's not that important.

16:07.220 --> 16:12.260
And I mean we could we could stack the logos on top of each other but that's just too much rum just

16:12.260 --> 16:17.760
to show some logos and they're way too small to leave it like this so I'm going to just get rid of that.

16:17.870 --> 16:21.980
And of course again if you guys want to do something different that's absolutely fine.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.180
But that's what I would do in this situation.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.030
So I'm going to go.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.850
Actually it's at a semicolon right here.

16:28.970 --> 16:42.710
I'm going to go below the hips below the ay which ends here and do dash Sam Dash C which is the logo

16:42.710 --> 16:45.630
section and I'm just going to display none.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.850
Get rid of it completely.

16:47.870 --> 16:50.950
So now if we go back that part is now gone.

16:51.660 --> 16:51.980
OK.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.450
So the about page looks pretty good.

16:54.470 --> 16:56.600
Let's go to the work is good.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.820
Let's go to the contact page.

16:58.820 --> 17:01.420
So let's see.

17:01.430 --> 17:07.800
Let's head over here and let's add a section for contact.

17:08.150 --> 17:17.060
So we have I.D. contact and let's target contact dash a.

17:17.420 --> 17:26.040
And I'm gonna grab the text fields class so text fields and we want to change the orientation of the

17:26.240 --> 17:27.380
the the inputs.

17:27.380 --> 17:36.140
So again we're gonna do grid template areas and let's set.

17:36.140 --> 17:36.770
Name

17:39.690 --> 17:41.860
Email actually.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.390
Subject

17:46.450 --> 17:52.760
e-mail phone and message.

17:53.170 --> 17:56.460
OK so we're just kind of stacking all those inputs.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.470
So I save that we go back.

17:58.480 --> 18:03.880
Now he can see that they're all stacked so the next part is this.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.470
This right here.

18:05.470 --> 18:15.610
I also want to stack these so we can actually let's actually add that up above where we put all the

18:15.610 --> 18:17.610
other stuff we want stacked.

18:17.680 --> 18:24.250
So what is the selector for this.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.500
So it's contact info is the grid.

18:27.500 --> 18:27.720
OK.

18:27.730 --> 18:31.030
So we can just go back here and I mean here

18:34.620 --> 18:40.670
let's say dots contact info.

18:40.690 --> 18:45.210
Now if I save that wait a minute why is

18:50.060 --> 18:51.600
contact info.

19:00.090 --> 19:03.080
Actually we might have to add this section.

19:03.240 --> 19:08.060
We should do that anyway so contact B so let's do I.D..

19:08.070 --> 19:14.630
Contact B contact info.

19:14.650 --> 19:15.130
There we go.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.630
OK so now these are stacked.

19:17.860 --> 19:23.380
And the reason for that is because that's the selector we used to add to the.

19:24.190 --> 19:25.990
The repeat 3 1 FA

19:28.670 --> 19:31.070
now that still doesn't look very good.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.930
I want to separate these a little bit.

19:32.930 --> 19:39.810
I also want to add a little faint Porter below each one like we did on the home page so let's jump down

19:39.810 --> 19:45.660
here and let's target contact dash B

19:50.780 --> 20:00.860
and we want to target the div or the divs inside and let's set a margin bottom of one room.

20:00.920 --> 20:09.050
Let's do a padding bottom of one room and let's do a border.

20:09.190 --> 20:11.800
Border bottom.

20:12.380 --> 20:19.060
So the border bottom I'm going to set to one pixel and I'm just gonna use the hardcoded color.

20:19.070 --> 20:24.500
I'm gonna use 5 5 5 solid.

20:24.700 --> 20:33.070
I mean we could use a variable by it has a dark background so we can't use dark and I think medium is

20:33.070 --> 20:34.320
a little too light.

20:34.330 --> 20:35.580
I want it to be very faint.

20:35.590 --> 20:37.290
So that's why I hardcoded this.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.330
But again you can do what you want.

20:40.540 --> 20:44.200
And then we don't want a border for the last child or margin or padding.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.350
So let's do ampersand.

20:47.350 --> 20:54.220
Last Child and let's set the border to none set.

20:54.250 --> 21:01.570
Margin bottom to zero and padding bottom to zero.

21:03.190 --> 21:04.080
So save that.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.580
Go back and there we go.

21:06.580 --> 21:07.810
It looks pretty good.

21:07.810 --> 21:13.320
Now I do want to make this text smaller so I'm going to go and see.

21:13.330 --> 21:20.680
So that Section C. So we want to be in contact we'll go under B and let's do Ampersand dash C and we

21:20.680 --> 21:26.080
want to target the H one and it's for REM.

21:26.110 --> 21:33.840
By default I believe so I'm going to set it to two REM.

21:33.860 --> 21:34.190
All right.

21:34.190 --> 21:35.950
We'll save that.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.310
And there it goes.

21:37.370 --> 21:38.210
That looks better.

21:38.690 --> 21:38.990
OK.

21:39.020 --> 21:40.310
So this looks pretty good.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.970
Let's check it out on an iPhone 5.

21:44.090 --> 21:50.150
So if it passes the iPhone 5 test I think we're good and looks nice.

21:50.330 --> 21:51.020
About

21:53.630 --> 21:57.200
work contact.

21:57.290 --> 21:58.040
Good.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.420
Now the last thing I want to look at is landscape mode.

22:01.430 --> 22:03.660
I'm going to go to iPhone X and turn it.

22:03.680 --> 22:10.190
Now I'd like this to be in the middle on landscape mode and you can see that the button is actually

22:10.550 --> 22:14.780
outside of the the container here or the it's below the fold.

22:14.780 --> 22:17.090
So we want to just move this.

22:17.450 --> 22:25.280
So I'm going to jump in here to media SPSS and I'm gonna go at the very bottom and let's do a media

22:25.310 --> 22:26.690
query for landscape.

22:26.690 --> 22:29.420
So to do this we want to target the height.

22:29.420 --> 22:36.140
So let's do media in let's say Max height of five 80 pixels

22:38.640 --> 22:40.590
and we want to grab the header home.

22:40.590 --> 22:45.100
So header dash home.

22:45.780 --> 22:48.480
And then we want the header content which is inside of it.

22:48.480 --> 22:57.420
So class header content and I'm going to set the padding top to just three round.

22:57.420 --> 22:59.360
So that should move it up.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.310
If we go back there we go.

23:01.310 --> 23:04.930
So everything is now in view.

23:05.150 --> 23:05.470
All right.

23:05.500 --> 23:13.240
And even if we go to the let's go to the galaxy and it looks good.

23:13.240 --> 23:25.280
IPhone 5 so the iPhone 5 I mean I guess it's so small it's it's kind of hard to deal with.

23:25.290 --> 23:31.710
I guess what we could do is set another media query for the height see how the it's 320 it's really

23:31.830 --> 23:32.510
small.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.090
The iPhone X height is 325.

23:36.090 --> 23:38.880
Let's see the galaxy is 360.

23:38.880 --> 23:47.160
Pixel is in landscape is for 11 so let's set up so go to iPhone 5.

23:47.190 --> 23:58.270
Let's set 1 for 3 20 and what we'll do is I guess I mean we'll reduce the font size of the heading here.

23:58.470 --> 24:08.370
So let's actually copy this and let's say a max height of will do Thriller three thirty.

24:08.830 --> 24:12.290
And if that's the case then let's take call we see.

24:12.310 --> 24:13.840
Just want to check the each team out.

24:16.760 --> 24:26.980
So it's this each one right here so the header content each one which what's the size by default.

24:27.210 --> 24:33.660
I didn't plan on doing this that's why I'm checking all this so the size by default is for RAM so I

24:33.660 --> 24:35.970
guess we could change it to two Ram.

24:35.970 --> 24:50.740
So we'll say header home header content H1 and we'll set the font size 2 to see if that works out OK.

24:50.770 --> 24:56.800
So I think that that's that's good enough not too many people have iPhone 5 anymore at least that I

24:56.800 --> 24:58.320
know of.

24:58.340 --> 25:05.110
And then if we go back to something bigger than 330 heights you'll see that the H One is back to four.

25:06.040 --> 25:06.330
All right.

25:06.340 --> 25:11.410
So that's it guys we have created our project in the next video.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.250
I want to get it ready to deploy to nullify.

25:14.260 --> 25:17.880
And I want to make the contact form work as well.
