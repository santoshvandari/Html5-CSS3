00:00.360 --> 00:03.620
All right so we're going to take a look at the project we'll be building in this section.

00:03.630 --> 00:07.790
It's called news grid and it's basically a UI for a news Web site.

00:07.800 --> 00:13.080
And it's going to be pretty simple in terms of the the number of pages we're just going to have a home

00:13.140 --> 00:13.620
about.

00:13.620 --> 00:18.990
And then we have a single article page which we'll take a look at and obviously we'll be using the grid

00:18.990 --> 00:20.050
system here.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.930
And I'm just gonna go through this real quick.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.760
So we have a Navarre that sticky so it sticks to the top wherever we go.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.990
And this logo here is just something that I created in Photoshop.

00:30.090 --> 00:36.510
It took an icon cutting added some color to it added some text and I might add on a bonus video showing

00:36.510 --> 00:38.670
you how to do something like that in photoshop.

00:38.670 --> 00:44.180
I also created a light version down here for it to be placed on dark backgrounds.

00:44.340 --> 00:50.280
So we have the now var we have some font awesome social media icons here we have our links and then

00:50.280 --> 00:55.770
we have this showcase area which would be like a featured article and we're using an overlay we're going

00:55.770 --> 01:01.350
to use the before pseudo selector as we looked at in a past video.

01:01.350 --> 01:05.910
We're using the grid to kind of push all this over to the side and then of course down here we're using

01:05.910 --> 01:07.290
grid CSX.

01:07.290 --> 01:10.710
And this one for instance is going to span over a column.

01:10.710 --> 01:12.140
This one spans over.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.080
We're going to have different utility classes for different background colors.

01:16.080 --> 01:23.030
We'll be using CSX variables all the images you see here you'll have in a folder called Image Resources.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.890
In this lecture and then the footer we're using the grid as well we have these four different sections.

01:27.900 --> 01:34.410
And then this one that spans all the way across just the copyright and then the the about page is very

01:34.410 --> 01:39.590
simple we just have a main area and then we have our sidebar we're using the grid here.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.550
And the article page is similar.

01:42.660 --> 01:48.690
We have the main article with an image some meta info like the author of the date the category.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.680
And then on the side we have the categories links which don't go anywhere.

01:53.820 --> 01:57.340
And then the join our club a little widget here.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.740
So any any other grid items we add here would get placed on the sidebar.

02:01.770 --> 02:07.810
So it's very efficient if you are scalable if you want to add more content all right.

02:07.810 --> 02:13.180
Now let's take a look at the responsive version so I'm going to open up my dev tools and let's take

02:13.180 --> 02:14.010
a look.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.840
This is a landscape iPhone X.

02:17.110 --> 02:19.660
So as you can see it looks pretty good.

02:19.660 --> 02:20.230
Let's turn.

02:20.230 --> 02:26.830
Turn this around in portrait mode and everything is stacked on top of each other nice and neatly.

02:26.830 --> 02:29.350
If you look at the about page same thing.

02:29.740 --> 02:33.800
Let's take a look at an iPad OK.

02:33.830 --> 02:39.300
So on the iPad I just kept the inner pages having the two columns here on the home page.

02:39.300 --> 02:45.870
I change this grid to have to be in two columns rather than stacked because I think that on an iPad

02:45.900 --> 02:51.120
it's too wide to have just one per row or just one column.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.070
So we have two here.

02:53.340 --> 03:00.270
And if I take it out of this mode and you'll see that as I bring the browser down I hit 768.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.660
It's going to go into two and then when I hit 600 it goes into one.

03:05.700 --> 03:11.490
So it's very responsive and I think that you're going to learn a lot in this project.

03:11.490 --> 03:11.730
All right.

03:11.730 --> 03:12.990
So let's go ahead and get started.
