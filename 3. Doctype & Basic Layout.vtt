WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:05.390
All right guys so in the last video we created an index each team I'll file.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.860
We opened it inside of a browser so we could see how it renders.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.160
And this is not the standard of how to create a document.

00:14.160 --> 00:18.660
There's some other things that you need to add even if we only wanted to display this in the browser.

00:18.660 --> 00:23.380
There's some other tags that we need to add for it to be a valid HDMI all five document.

00:23.430 --> 00:29.850
Now before we do anything I'm going to rename this file so instead of index I'm going to rename it to

00:29.850 --> 00:36.410
0 1 underscore basic underscore layout dot HD CML.

00:36.420 --> 00:42.600
Because like I said I want this to be a sandbox so you can go back to and you can check certain things

00:42.600 --> 00:47.650
and I want each file to be named after what what we're doing inside of it.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.430
OK so we're gonna just number them.

00:50.430 --> 00:53.460
So they're in order if you don't want to number them you don't have to.

00:53.490 --> 00:58.770
You could call it just basic layout or basic or whatever but I want to be very specific and I want to.

00:58.790 --> 01:01.600
I want you guys to have this for future reference.

01:01.650 --> 01:01.950
All right.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.180
So basic layout of an H team page.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.570
Let's actually just get rid of this for now.

01:06.570 --> 01:10.950
So the first thing that you're going to want on every page female page is the doc type.

01:11.100 --> 01:11.420
OK.

01:11.430 --> 01:12.770
So I'm just gonna type this out.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.160
It's gonna be an angle bracket.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.690
Exclamation Doc type usually all capitals.

01:17.820 --> 01:21.170
And then h team L and then closing angle bracket.

01:21.210 --> 01:26.370
So this is a doc type and what this does is it tells the browser what type of document it is because

01:26.370 --> 01:28.740
a browser can read each team all five.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.900
It can read x h t AML it can read H team all four point zero point one.

01:34.080 --> 01:40.020
So there's a lot of different variations of each team out but each team of five is definitely the standard

01:40.020 --> 01:41.550
and that's what you're gonna want to use.

01:42.180 --> 01:48.630
It's also it's also much easier than the others and it's less strict when it comes to tag syntax.

01:48.660 --> 01:55.500
So I just want to quickly show you from the W3 schools dot com site which is a great site for reference.

01:55.890 --> 01:58.470
This is a page all on dog types.

01:58.470 --> 02:03.930
And if we go down here you'll see that the dog type declaration must be the very first thing in your

02:03.930 --> 02:09.360
age team I'll document before the age team l tag which I'll go over in a second and down here it gives

02:09.360 --> 02:10.580
us the different types.

02:10.590 --> 02:16.230
So for age HTML5 it's what we what we just did but then you'll see that each team all four point zero

02:16.230 --> 02:24.300
point one actually has a much longer dock type because there's different variations of strict transitional

02:24.840 --> 02:25.700
frame set.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.820
And this has to do with what's allowed and what's not.

02:28.830 --> 02:33.030
So it's gotten much easier over the years with each team of five.

02:33.050 --> 02:38.580
So we don't have to worry about these dog types but I just wanted to show you that there are very different

02:38.920 --> 02:45.750
ex each team Al has its own dog type has transitional frame set one point zero one point one but this

02:45.750 --> 02:48.230
is the only one that we have to worry about.

02:48.270 --> 02:48.530
All right.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.520
So I just wanted to kind of show you that so we're declaring this document as each team of five.

02:53.550 --> 02:57.150
The next thing we want is in each team l tag.

02:57.150 --> 02:57.410
OK.

02:57.420 --> 03:01.740
So we'll do each team L and then hit enter a tab and then we'll finish it for me.

03:01.740 --> 03:06.680
And we just want to hit enter so that the bottom tag is down below.

03:06.810 --> 03:11.550
And now inside the each team I'll tag we have a head tag.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.110
And then under the head we have a body tag.

03:15.120 --> 03:20.520
Now notice that there's an indent here and V.S. code will do this automatically if you're using something

03:20.520 --> 03:25.740
like Notepad which I would definitely not suggest it's not going to indented for you automatically so

03:25.740 --> 03:27.680
you have to do it yourself.

03:27.690 --> 03:33.890
Now the reason it's indented is because both of these tags are inside the H html tag.

03:33.890 --> 03:34.190
OK.

03:34.200 --> 03:40.590
This is actually the parent of these two tags and these are the children of the H team l tag.

03:40.710 --> 03:44.430
Now the head and body are very different.

03:44.430 --> 03:50.590
Head is for things like medal tags if you want to associate keywords with your page.

03:50.700 --> 03:56.820
It's basically just information about your page it doesn't actually display in the browser in the body

03:56.820 --> 03:58.470
of the browser.

03:58.470 --> 04:03.090
Now one thing that you should definitely put in the head tag is the title.

04:03.390 --> 04:03.700
OK.

04:03.720 --> 04:09.750
So we want to put a title tag and again we're tagging it over because it's within the head tag for the

04:09.750 --> 04:12.770
title I'm just going to say my Web site.

04:12.830 --> 04:13.170
All right.

04:13.260 --> 04:21.000
Now if I go ahead and save this and do control X I'm going to save the file and let's open it up.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.120
So we have our basic layout dot aged him out because we renamed it.

04:24.150 --> 04:28.800
And I'm going to stay open with Chrome and notice there's nothing in the body.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.890
But if we look in the tab we see my web site.

04:31.890 --> 04:35.440
Whatever you put in the title tag is gonna show right here.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.470
OK so it's very important for you to have a title.

04:38.580 --> 04:44.290
Now whatever we want the body we put in the body so we can put back our H one.

04:44.370 --> 04:48.510
Say my Web site and we can put our paragraph

04:53.820 --> 04:58.310
and we'll go ahead and save and we'll go back and reload.

04:58.380 --> 05:01.700
And now we have our H one in paragraph in the body.

05:02.080 --> 05:02.410
OK.

05:02.430 --> 05:08.850
So anything that you want to show in this area is going to go in the body of your your document.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.270
All right so you just want to keep this structure in mind.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.100
This is the the core fundamental mandatory structure of an aged him I'll document.

05:16.110 --> 05:18.050
You have your doc type at the top.

05:18.120 --> 05:23.280
You have your h team all tags that wrap around everything and then you have a head and body area in

05:23.280 --> 05:23.640
your head.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.830
You should at least have the title and then the body.

05:25.830 --> 05:28.740
You just have whatever you your Web site content will be.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.840
So the last thing I want to show you is how to create a comment case so you might want to label stuff

05:33.870 --> 05:36.510
without it actually rendering in the browser.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.270
So let's say I wanted to put a comment right here.

05:39.390 --> 05:45.000
What I would do is put an angle bracket an exclamation mark and then double hyphen.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.430
Once I do that and V.S. code it actually auto completes the rest of it.

05:48.540 --> 05:52.630
But this is the format of a comment so I'll just say this is a comment.

05:52.710 --> 05:57.080
So starts off like this and then it ends with double hyphen and an angle bracket.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.300
So just make sure you don't forget the exclamation.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.270
Because that's not a valid comment.

06:01.440 --> 06:06.310
And notice that it turns green and V.S. code to let you know that it's it's actually a comment.

06:06.350 --> 06:12.270
And if I save this and we go to the browser and reload notice it doesn't show here because it's a comment

06:12.750 --> 06:16.660
now in browsers you can view the source code.

06:16.800 --> 06:22.800
You can view the HD him I'll source on a Mac you can do command option you add on Windows I believe

06:22.800 --> 06:28.920
it's control you and it will open up a new tab that shows you the actual HD CML so you can see our dock

06:28.920 --> 06:31.100
type are each terminal tags all that stuff.

06:31.110 --> 06:34.490
It also will show the comments in the source code.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.730
OK just to let you know that.

06:36.510 --> 06:41.770
So let's go back and I want to show you how you can common out something that's already there.

06:41.790 --> 06:48.960
So if I just put my tab my cursor on this line right here in this code I can actually just do control

06:48.990 --> 06:54.600
and then forward slash work or a question mark the same key the forward slash question mark.

06:54.630 --> 06:59.160
So if I hold control and hit that it will comment the whole line out and I can toggle it if I hit it

06:59.160 --> 07:06.000
again control forward slash I can just toggle the comment if I wanted to come comment out multiple lines

07:06.000 --> 07:11.580
I could highlight them and again control forward slash and that will comment out the whole thing.

07:11.580 --> 07:17.280
There may be times when you want to just kind of not show a certain part of the team Al Allen the browser

07:17.310 --> 07:22.140
and you want to comment it out OK and you can put this on a separate line as well like that.

07:22.140 --> 07:22.910
That will still work.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.110
This is all commented out.

07:25.290 --> 07:28.730
All right so that's going to be it for this video guys in the next one.

07:28.740 --> 07:35.430
I want to give you some tips and tricks with is code for instance we can generate the basic structure

07:35.700 --> 07:39.840
automatically without having to type all this out with every age team Al page.

07:39.830 --> 07:45.090
I also want to give you a couple extensions that I want to recommend and that I'll be using in this

07:45.090 --> 07:45.750
course.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.280
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
