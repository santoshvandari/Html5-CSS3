WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:00.560
All right.

00:00.570 --> 00:06.960
So we've completed our initial each team on CSX but I want to just add a little bit of JavaScript here

00:06.960 --> 00:08.380
to make this dynamic.

00:08.400 --> 00:14.920
OK so we're going to add some lines of JavaScript in a j ust file and then we're going to edit the CSX

00:14.970 --> 00:19.200
a little bit because we need to kind of change how this works.

00:19.200 --> 00:25.790
Basically what we need to do is check to see as we scroll down we need to fire off an event that's going

00:25.790 --> 00:31.560
to check to see if a certain list item certain box here is actually in the viewport.

00:31.880 --> 00:32.180
OK.

00:32.190 --> 00:36.930
So right now the python one is not in the viewport but when I scroll down it starts to enter.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.010
It is.

00:38.010 --> 00:39.290
Now when it hits that point.

00:39.290 --> 00:46.410
We want this to basically just come in fade in from the right or from the left on this side and the

00:46.410 --> 00:51.450
way that we're going to do that is with JavaScript we're going to add dynamically add a class called

00:51.450 --> 00:55.380
show which will add a transform to to bring it in.

00:55.740 --> 00:56.060
OK.

00:56.070 --> 01:01.860
We're gonna initially hide these things at first and then the show class will allow them to basically

01:01.860 --> 01:03.020
animate in.

01:03.220 --> 01:09.480
So let's create a new file called Main dot J.S. the javascript file and I'm going to paste this code

01:09.480 --> 01:10.370
in.

01:10.470 --> 01:15.450
And again this is not a javascript course so I'm not going to explain every single line here but basically

01:15.450 --> 01:21.210
what's going on is we're grabbing onto all the timeline list items so basically each of these and we're

01:21.210 --> 01:27.240
putting it in a variable called items and then down here we have a function called Run which is looping

01:27.240 --> 01:28.170
through those items.

01:28.170 --> 01:32.000
So it's going through each one and it's checking to see if it's in the viewport.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.530
That's what this function does right here.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.700
And if it is in the viewport it's going to add the class of show.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.050
All right.

01:39.060 --> 01:43.830
So that's exactly what this does it loops through all of these list items checks to see if it's in the

01:43.830 --> 01:47.180
viewport if it is it adds the class of show.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.330
Now down here we're just firing it off.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.180
We're firing off this run when the page loads.

01:52.180 --> 01:52.400
OK.

01:52.410 --> 01:57.810
So when the page loads if anything is in the viewport it's going to just slide in also on resize so

01:57.810 --> 01:59.690
if we resize the browser it'll run.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.830
And then if we scroll it will also run.

02:01.860 --> 02:06.770
So every time something enters the viewport it should add the class of show.

02:06.780 --> 02:11.820
Now that's all javascript is doing is adding this this class of show we have to handle the rest of it

02:11.820 --> 02:12.920
in the CSX.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.570
So you can see how they work together.

02:15.570 --> 02:21.360
So let's save this file and let's go to index each team Ali make sure we include it and JavaScript files

02:21.420 --> 02:25.950
for ninety nine percent of the time you want to include them at the bottom of the page right above the

02:25.950 --> 02:26.450
body.

02:26.910 --> 02:34.640
So we're going to put a script tag and we're going to add a source attribute pointing to main dot J.S.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.410
and we'll save.

02:36.630 --> 02:37.000
OK.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.630
Now nothing is going to happen yet because all we've done is included the javascript.

02:42.660 --> 02:48.520
But I can show you if we open up our chrome tools here let's actually just make this bigger.

02:48.570 --> 02:52.740
Now I want to show you what the javascript file is actually doing.

02:52.740 --> 03:00.390
So I'm going to go to elements and if we look at our you'll notice that these allies all have a class

03:00.390 --> 03:01.640
of show.

03:01.650 --> 03:01.940
OK.

03:01.950 --> 03:10.620
So even though this this fourth one here is in the viewport it's it's it has to be fully in the viewport.

03:10.620 --> 03:15.540
So if I scroll down a little bit as soon as it's fully in the viewport notice that this class of show

03:15.540 --> 03:16.740
got added.

03:16.740 --> 03:23.190
If I keep scrolling as soon as the next one is fully in the viewport just watch over here on the right.

03:23.250 --> 03:26.010
Keep scrolling there's that one that one.

03:26.010 --> 03:31.290
So it's just it's just adding that class of show to the document object model.

03:31.290 --> 03:33.380
So it's adding that class to the ally.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.880
And that's exactly what we want the javascript to do.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.280
Now we have to handle the rest and CSX.

03:38.400 --> 03:49.800
So let's jump over to styled dot CSX and I'm going to add a couple of things in a few places so I mean

03:51.120 --> 03:55.890
by default we don't want this stuff to show unless the class of show is added to it.

03:55.920 --> 03:56.250
Right.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.220
So let's go to the div.

03:59.220 --> 04:10.160
OK so this box is the UL allied div and we want to add on here a visibility of hidden.

04:10.860 --> 04:15.330
And then we want to also add an opacity value of zero.

04:15.330 --> 04:21.450
Now when I save this and we go back everything disappears which is what we want because we'll we're

04:21.520 --> 04:27.240
going gonna make it so they only show if the class of show is on them which they are right now but we

04:27.240 --> 04:30.440
haven't added the rest of the the CSF that we need.

04:31.050 --> 04:41.390
So right here for the the right side and the left side we actually want to have these pushed over a

04:41.390 --> 04:42.170
little bit.

04:42.200 --> 04:47.030
So actually I'm going to comment what we just did out these two lines for a second because I do want

04:47.030 --> 04:52.180
these to show I'm going to just close this up so we can see both at the same time.

04:52.370 --> 04:54.680
So we'll go like right here.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.150
All right.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.660
Now for the left and right we want these to come in.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.130
You know this will come in this way.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.270
This will come in this way.

05:02.270 --> 05:13.820
So I'm going to add an initial transform value of translate and we want to say we want do we want to

05:13.820 --> 05:18.440
do 200 pixels on the x axis.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.490
Okay I guess we could do translate X but we'll just do it this way.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.190
So translate on the x axis 200 pixels.

05:25.190 --> 05:34.010
Now if I save this over here you can see that this is now pushed over two hundred pixels and we want

05:34.010 --> 05:36.980
to go to the left side.

05:37.330 --> 05:41.180
We're going to pace this in the same thing except we're gonna do negative two hundred pixels because

05:41.180 --> 05:43.450
we want it to be pulled over that way.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.310
Now once the show class hits we want these to come in.

05:47.330 --> 05:54.290
So basically we want them to go to trance transform translate 0 to bring them back.

05:54.290 --> 06:03.050
So let's add the show class we'll go I guess what we'll go right we'll go at the bottom here and we'll

06:03.050 --> 06:13.610
say show boxes we want to grab the timeline you l l ally with the class of show and then the div came

06:13.640 --> 06:17.620
remember the div is what is is the box really.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.850
So we want to set transform

06:22.630 --> 06:24.900
to none.

06:24.930 --> 06:25.450
OK.

06:25.460 --> 06:32.840
Because we set the transform to be offset on each side initially but as soon as they're shown we want

06:32.840 --> 06:39.860
them to come in to transform none which would just be you know set them to their their natural spot.

06:40.310 --> 06:47.460
So if I save this and I reload you can see that the ones that have the class of show are coming in now.

06:47.600 --> 06:54.770
We want to make these disappear so let's go back up to the visibility and opacity and let's uncommon

06:54.800 --> 06:56.240
that case.

06:56.300 --> 06:59.140
Now if we save that everything should disappear.

06:59.450 --> 07:10.510
But if we go back down to the show we want to set the visibility to visible.

07:10.580 --> 07:17.140
We also want to set the opacity to 1 which is which is just solid opaque.

07:17.360 --> 07:17.650
All right.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.300
So let's save this.

07:19.640 --> 07:24.620
And now remember that when the page loads the first three you already have the class of show because

07:24.620 --> 07:30.440
they're in the viewport and then I'm going to scroll down a little bit and as soon as the Ruby on Rails

07:30.440 --> 07:32.680
one gets in the viewport it slides in.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.010
Next one slides in.

07:34.010 --> 07:35.180
Next one slide.

07:35.720 --> 07:40.370
So what's all that's going on with the JavaScript as it's adding the class of show and then then the

07:40.370 --> 07:47.720
CSX we're saying you know initially make everything disappear but as soon as that show is added to the

07:48.020 --> 07:54.320
to the DOM here to the list item we want that div to transform none meaning come back to its original

07:54.320 --> 08:00.130
spot and also display with the visibility visible and opacity 1.

08:00.140 --> 08:05.920
Now the last thing I want to do is I want these dots here to be white by default.

08:05.930 --> 08:11.140
And then as soon as the show classes comes in then it will be blue.

08:11.150 --> 08:18.460
So let's go up to a we created the DOT which is right here we used ally after and we created the 25

08:18.560 --> 08:26.250
pixel heighten with border radius 50 percent and we have the background set to the secondary color.

08:26.300 --> 08:33.140
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this background secondary color and then change this one

08:33.140 --> 08:34.760
to just inherit.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.990
OK so if I save that now they're going to be white.

08:39.810 --> 08:50.160
But down here let's go right under where we put the the Allied dots show div and we're gonna do timeline

08:51.660 --> 08:57.180
U L L I dot show and remember the after.

08:57.180 --> 09:02.760
That's where the DOT is so we're going to do after and then we'll paste in the background secondary

09:02.760 --> 09:03.160
colors.

09:03.170 --> 09:10.890
So this dot is gonna get the background of the secondary color when the show class is added so let's

09:10.890 --> 09:12.090
save.

09:12.150 --> 09:14.480
And now you can see that the first three are blue.

09:14.550 --> 09:15.860
This one down here is white.

09:15.870 --> 09:19.260
But as soon as it comes in it turns blue.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.820
All right so that's gonna be a guys hopefully you enjoyed this little project here and learn quite a

09:23.820 --> 09:30.480
bit about CSX and transitions and how to integrate it with JavaScript and don't worry if you don't understand

09:30.510 --> 09:32.150
every line of the javascript.

09:32.250 --> 09:37.200
Basically though it's just looking to see if an element if a list item is in the viewport if it is it's

09:37.200 --> 09:40.560
adding a class of show that's all the script is doing.

09:40.560 --> 09:40.860
All right.

09:40.860 --> 09:41.640
So that's it.

09:41.670 --> 09:43.980
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
