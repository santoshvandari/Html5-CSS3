00:00.120 --> 00:06.330
OK so in the last video we looked at key frames and we looked at how we could animate different properties

00:06.330 --> 00:11.630
such as the position the with the color but we just did a two and a from.

00:11.630 --> 00:16.350
So basically a starting point and an ending point but with key frames you can actually have more than

00:16.350 --> 00:19.310
just those points you can you can use percentages.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.070
So that's what I want to go over in this video.

00:21.360 --> 00:30.150
So when we create a new full file here called 0 8 underscore key frames and say key frames to dot each

00:30.150 --> 00:31.190
team out.

00:32.250 --> 00:32.680
OK.

00:32.760 --> 00:41.760
And I'm just going to close the sidebar up here and that's a key frames too and we'll put in our style

00:41.760 --> 00:42.390
tags

00:45.930 --> 00:53.480
and I'm just gonna have again just an I.D. of or let's do that I do an idea or a class.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.200
And the last one I want to be a little consistent here.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.680
So we have a class of box.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.300
Let's do that same thing.

01:00.300 --> 01:10.590
So box and in the style let's add box will make the background dark like we did in the last one.

01:10.650 --> 01:16.780
So party background three three three.

01:16.890 --> 01:22.570
So the box will give it a background color of white.

01:22.570 --> 01:33.090
And let's set the width to 200 pixels in height to 200 pixels.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.720
I should probably spell background correctly.

01:35.940 --> 01:42.540
And we're also going to position this relative because we're gonna be dealing with positional properties.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.520
So it's a position relative.

01:45.540 --> 01:52.500
And let's save this and open this up with live server case we have our box.

01:52.720 --> 01:57.970
Now I'm going to add an animation here with a key frame and I'm just going to add I'm just going to

01:57.970 --> 02:06.190
use the animation property instead of using all the separate properties and we'll say animates one let's

02:06.190 --> 02:14.080
say we'll have the span will be a five second span forward so that it stays where it's at when it ends

02:15.010 --> 02:19.030
and lets to ease we'll do ease in and out.

02:19.660 --> 02:19.990
All right.

02:20.020 --> 02:30.690
So just like in the last video we're going to create a key frames and let's call it enemy 1.

02:31.540 --> 02:38.230
And before what we did is we did two and from but in this case I want to use percentages so basically

02:38.530 --> 02:40.420
zero percent of the starting point.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.970
We already have set here.

02:43.120 --> 02:49.480
In fact I'm going to set the position that I want which is top 0 left 0

02:53.050 --> 03:04.250
left 0 and then I'm going to say well at 25 percent I want it to be top zero.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.590
So I still want it to be at the top but I want it to be left.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.010
Let's say three hundred pixels.

03:10.010 --> 03:16.860
Now what I want this to do ultimately is I want it to go from here over down back over and up.

03:16.870 --> 03:23.380
So a complete circle complete you know 360 360 degrees.

03:23.380 --> 03:27.040
So let's go ahead and save this and see what happens.

03:27.130 --> 03:34.590
So it gets pushed over and it's going to end in the same spot over a period of five seconds.

03:34.690 --> 03:35.210
Okay.

03:35.230 --> 03:40.570
Now obviously we want we want to add onto this we want to go down after.

03:40.720 --> 03:49.330
So let's go right under this and say it 50 percent of the base basically like the timeline we want it

03:49.330 --> 03:56.860
to be top three hundred pixels because we want it to move down and we still want left to be 300 pixels.

03:56.860 --> 03:57.880
So let's try that.

03:57.890 --> 03:58.650
We'll save.

03:58.810 --> 04:05.490
Goes over goes down and it's going to end up in the in the starting position.

04:05.620 --> 04:05.950
All right.

04:05.950 --> 04:12.850
So next thing we want to do is add 75 percent and it doesn't have to be 25 50 75.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.310
You can use any point in the timeline that you want.

04:15.940 --> 04:19.550
So here I want it to be from the left.

04:19.690 --> 04:27.390
Let's do top four so top I still want to be 300 pixels but the left I want it to be zero because I wanted

04:27.400 --> 04:28.510
to go back over.

04:28.510 --> 04:34.660
So let's save goes over down back over and up.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.170
OK.

04:35.170 --> 04:42.010
Now I would just want to make sure that at 100 percent which is basically the ending point I want it's

04:42.010 --> 04:47.020
to be back in its original place which is top 0 left 0.

04:47.080 --> 04:47.410
All right.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.480
So now our square just does a complete square.

04:52.510 --> 04:56.380
Now obviously we can change other properties if we want.

04:56.410 --> 04:59.680
So let's say at every point we want to change the color.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.030
So let's do it here.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.590
Background red.

05:04.030 --> 05:09.700
And then at 50 percent we'll say background green.

05:10.260 --> 05:17.100
Let's do background blue.

05:17.800 --> 05:22.580
And then at the ending point let's do background white.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.480
OK we'll save that.

05:24.640 --> 05:29.430
And you can see it changes to red to green to blue and to white.

05:29.470 --> 05:31.630
Now let's do something else.

05:31.630 --> 05:34.060
We can also animate the border radius.

05:34.180 --> 05:36.670
Let's do border radius.

05:36.730 --> 05:41.470
I don't know if I showed this to you guys but you can have more than one value and it pertains to each

05:41.470 --> 05:42.000
corner.

05:42.010 --> 05:49.150
So let's say we want the left call on top left to be 50 percent so basically rounded and then the other

05:49.150 --> 05:50.300
one zero.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.720
So I save that.

05:52.030 --> 05:58.290
Notice that it turns into 50 percent when it goes to 25 percent.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.330
OK this this corner here.

06:00.490 --> 06:09.010
Now I'm going to copy this and then right here let's say we want both both the top corners to be rounded

06:09.040 --> 06:14.630
so 50 percent and then we'll go down here and then we want the top.

06:15.490 --> 06:19.890
So 50 percent and then also the bottom right.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.550
I believe this is will be 50 percent.

06:22.660 --> 06:30.740
And then by the end it should be a complete circle so we'll just say border radius 50 percent like that.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.990
Meaning all corners.

06:33.190 --> 06:38.060
So with each iteration each corner changes and by the end it's a circle.

06:38.080 --> 06:44.230
So I mean obviously this animation is is it's not very practical it's not something you would actually

06:44.590 --> 06:52.240
put in in a project but it gives you the the tools that you need to be able to create some cool stuff.

06:52.240 --> 06:57.420
So you should be able to come up with some nice ideas as far as animation goes.

06:57.420 --> 07:04.450
It's not really my specialty but you know if you're if you're creative in that area you can do some

07:04.450 --> 07:08.050
really really awesome things with CSF animation.

07:08.830 --> 07:15.070
So in the next video we're going to continue on with with animations and we're going to look at transitions.
