00:00.270 --> 00:05.130
All right guys so in this video we're going to look at a pseudo selector or pseudo class called End

00:05.160 --> 00:05.820
Child.

00:05.820 --> 00:13.890
So I'm going to go ahead and our CSA sandbox to create a new file called Zero to underscore and underscore

00:14.370 --> 00:15.410
child Dot.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.260
Each team l I'm gonna change this.

00:18.270 --> 00:26.310
This targeted selectors just gonna do 0 1 just to stay consistent here.

00:26.700 --> 00:26.940
All right.

00:26.970 --> 00:38.730
So in the end in the child file let's go ahead and generate our head and body tags say and child and

00:38.730 --> 00:41.250
we want our style tags.

00:41.490 --> 00:50.450
Now as far as the H team l what I'm going to do is just have a U L and I want about 20 list items.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.140
So I'm going to say ally.

00:52.170 --> 00:58.470
And he's Emmet here and the content will be item and then an incremental number and I'm going to say

00:58.470 --> 01:01.510
time's 20 and then hit enter.

01:01.510 --> 01:05.940
OK so we'll go ahead and open this up we'll save it open with live server.

01:05.960 --> 01:09.420
Now I'm going to add some base styling for the list item.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.860
So I just want to add some padding.

01:12.270 --> 01:18.450
We'll say point to five REM and margin.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.440
Pardon.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.290
Zero point to five REM.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.620
And let's just take away the bullet items with list style.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.190
None.

01:28.200 --> 01:28.530
All right.

01:28.530 --> 01:33.360
Now we've seen first child and last child.

01:33.360 --> 01:41.160
So I'm just going to refresh your memory if you forget what these do basically we can select the first

01:41.160 --> 01:46.050
and last element and it doesn't have to be a list I do I'm just using list items that could be divs

01:46.050 --> 01:48.850
it could be whatever any element at all.

01:48.990 --> 01:54.730
But we're going to say ally and then the pseudo selector syntax is a colon.

01:54.750 --> 02:03.600
So we want to say first child and let's say background.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.010
Let's just do background rattle.

02:05.010 --> 02:06.720
Just use color names here.

02:06.720 --> 02:15.000
So that selects the first one and if we want the last one copy that and we'll just do last child and

02:15.000 --> 02:15.420
save.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.830
Now the last one is red.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.780
But what about all of these.

02:18.900 --> 02:24.900
You know what if we want to choose the fourth one or every every second one every even one every odd

02:24.900 --> 02:31.050
one for that we can use any child and anything is basically like kind of like a placeholder.

02:31.110 --> 02:35.680
So let's get let's say position three.

02:35.730 --> 02:44.640
So to do that we can say list item and we're gonna say n dash child and we're just going to pass in

02:44.640 --> 02:45.190
three.

02:46.300 --> 02:46.630
Okay.

02:46.650 --> 02:53.890
And then I'm going to say background and let's do a different color we'll do purple and save.

02:54.320 --> 02:59.600
And notice that the third one down is is purple.

02:59.610 --> 02:59.950
OK.

02:59.960 --> 03:06.650
So what if we wanted to do every three K not just the third one but every third one.

03:06.770 --> 03:12.510
We want to do so in that case it's a every three.

03:13.160 --> 03:23.950
So we could say andthe child and we can say three and plus zero.

03:23.970 --> 03:31.200
This is basically the formula that that we're gonna use here and let's say background and we'll do orange

03:32.830 --> 03:40.670
I save that I notice that every third one is orange and it replace the the this one here position three

03:41.030 --> 03:42.500
because it's further down.

03:42.530 --> 03:43.990
So it just kind of overrode.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.490
If I put important here and save then that's going to overwrite that.

03:49.490 --> 03:53.350
Now this formula that we passed in here is the counter.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.850
So this is the counter and then zero this is the offset K because we can offset.

03:57.860 --> 04:03.860
We can start it wherever we want in this case were starting at zero and as a shortcut we can just do

04:03.860 --> 04:04.800
three n.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.430
So I save that we're going to get the same result.

04:07.490 --> 04:14.330
Now let's say that I want to do every three but I wanted to start after the seventh item here.

04:14.930 --> 04:21.260
So let's put a comment in here we'll say every 3 after 7.

04:21.290 --> 04:29.990
So to do that we can put an end to child and then pass in 3 N and we want to do plus 7 which is our

04:29.990 --> 04:31.460
offset.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.030
Okay.

04:32.030 --> 04:38.520
And then I'll do background yellow and we'll save that.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.900
And notice that the yellow starts here.

04:40.920 --> 04:41.190
Okay.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.490
So this 7 this is the offset.

04:43.490 --> 04:48.050
We're basically gonna just we're not going to start it until we hit that seventh item and then we're

04:48.050 --> 04:50.810
going to do every three.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.480
Now a more common thing you're probably going to do is even an odd.

04:54.470 --> 05:14.120
So let's say every odd so we could do ally and child and we could pass in odd and let's do background.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.840
We'll do a light gray and save.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.950
And now every odd item here is going to be light gray.

05:23.240 --> 05:29.900
Now it's probably probably it's probably pretty obvious that we can do even as well so let's do that.

05:29.910 --> 05:39.200
Let's do even and we'll change this to let's do a shade darker shade lighter actually and save.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.620
And now every even is the.

05:41.630 --> 05:42.330
Like this.

05:42.330 --> 05:44.810
This DDD light gray.

05:44.900 --> 05:45.200
All right.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.140
So any child can be pretty handy.

05:47.150 --> 05:54.860
I remember before and the child was actually a thing we had to use javascript to dynamically select

05:54.890 --> 05:59.670
every other element there was it was just a pain in the neck guys if you're learning each team Allen

05:59.680 --> 06:08.390
CSX now you've missed a lot of just giant pains in the asses because things weren't I mean you know

06:08.780 --> 06:17.780
these selectors weren't around even like border radius wasn't around to do things like even place holders

06:17.780 --> 06:23.540
in our forms and our input forms we didn't have the place holder attribute before each team all five.

06:23.540 --> 06:28.880
So we would have to use javascript to put to have a value in but then had a click event.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.740
So when we clicked in the value went away which was just a giant pain in the neck.

06:33.770 --> 06:39.290
So you guys are lucky those of you that are learning this now that you don't have to go through that

06:39.290 --> 06:42.790
stuff and then browser compatibility is a whole new issue.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.130
All right.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.270
So that's that's the basis of.

06:45.400 --> 06:50.540
And the child in the next video we're going to look at the before and after pseudo selector and look

06:50.540 --> 06:52.100
at some practical uses for the.

06:52.100 --> 06:52.640
For that.
