WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:06.210
All right guys so in the last video we did the header the nav bar basically the landing part of the

00:06.210 --> 00:07.820
website on the index page.

00:07.830 --> 00:10.170
Now we're going to continue with the index page.

00:10.170 --> 00:15.340
And I also have a tab with the finished product just to see what we're gonna be getting at.

00:15.540 --> 00:23.350
Now the way I'm going to format this is each page is going to have sections so the sections I'm going

00:23.350 --> 00:28.410
to give an idea of the page name and then A B C D and so on.

00:28.410 --> 00:33.630
And the reason for that is you might end up changing the content so I don't want to call this like section

00:33.630 --> 00:36.130
specialize or something like that.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.920
I'm going to call this section home a k.

00:39.930 --> 00:41.490
This will be home B.

00:41.490 --> 00:47.880
This will be home C and then this will be the footer K on the about page will have about a about B about

00:47.880 --> 00:49.330
C and so on.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.800
So let's go ahead and move on to this right here.

00:51.800 --> 00:58.590
This specialize in part so I'm going to jump in to index each team out and let's go ahead and put a

00:58.590 --> 01:06.240
comment in here and we'll just say section A and we can put what it is in the comment that's always

01:06.240 --> 01:17.760
easy to change so we'll do specialize so let's do section with an I.D. of s..

01:17.820 --> 01:23.400
I'm sorry not section home because we want to because we don't have Section A on the home page and then

01:23.400 --> 01:25.190
Section A on the about page.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.910
So we're going to do home a And let's also

01:33.040 --> 01:39.100
yeah let's do this now so I'm going to give this a couple utility classes now we already have a text

01:39.730 --> 01:42.870
center utility class because I want everything centered.

01:42.970 --> 01:47.920
I'm also going to create some padding classes as we've done before I want P Y meaning padding on the

01:47.920 --> 01:49.730
top and bottom two.

01:50.050 --> 01:54.580
So well we'll at we'll create that class later on.

01:54.580 --> 01:57.380
But let's just finish the markup for now.

01:57.460 --> 02:01.780
So pretty much every section is gonna have a container.

02:01.810 --> 02:03.270
Want to move everything to the middle.

02:04.060 --> 02:16.420
Let's do an H two and we'll gonna have a class of Section dash title and we'll say I specialize in and

02:16.450 --> 02:23.290
underneath the H two we're gonna just have a class of bottom dash line.

02:23.510 --> 02:23.890
OK.

02:23.890 --> 02:27.960
And just to show you what that's going to look like it's gonna be this right here.

02:27.970 --> 02:28.300
OK.

02:28.330 --> 02:32.080
So we can use that around the site under the bottom line.

02:32.080 --> 02:37.600
Let's do a paragraph with the class of lead.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.890
And in here we're gonna say.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.500
So you're saying I specialize in in the most say

02:46.930 --> 02:57.310
photography as well as creating digital masterpieces.

02:57.370 --> 03:01.290
I might misspell some stuff here guys but I really don't care.

03:01.300 --> 03:14.480
So in UI UX layouts for Web sites for Web sites and mobile applications.

03:14.700 --> 03:21.820
OK we'll be a bit more descriptive than some of our other projects where we just use just alarm Epsom

03:22.690 --> 03:31.990
so underneath the paragraph we're gonna have a class of specials and inside here we're gonna have some

03:31.990 --> 03:36.070
divs and we're gonna be using the grid for this as well.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.710
So each div is gonna have an icon.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.420
So let's put an icon here.

03:40.420 --> 03:47.210
Let's do F.A. s and then we want a class of F A Dash file dash all.

03:47.470 --> 03:49.150
That's the icon we want to use.

03:49.210 --> 03:54.550
And then if we want to make an icon bigger font awesome have has classes for that we're gonna do F.A.

03:54.550 --> 03:57.520
dash to X so that's our icon.

03:57.530 --> 04:06.760
Then we're gonna put an H three and this is gonna be concept ing and then a paragraph and I believe

04:06.760 --> 04:11.040
I did Lord when he should be right.

04:11.320 --> 04:15.580
And then what we'll do is just copy this whole div and we want for these.

04:15.580 --> 04:19.930
So we've got one two three four.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.410
OK.

04:20.410 --> 04:24.010
And then I'm just going to change the second one here.

04:24.010 --> 04:35.440
Let's do instead of this file all let's do F.A. dash desktop and the heading is gonna be UI dash UX.

04:36.070 --> 04:43.090
And then this third one here will be a dash object dash on group.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.980
These are just icons I found on font awesome.

04:46.120 --> 04:51.730
And then this is gonna be visual design.

04:51.730 --> 05:00.320
And then this last one here is gonna be thumbs up so thumbs dash up and the heading for this is gonna

05:00.340 --> 05:06.130
be interaction.

05:06.130 --> 05:06.540
OK.

05:06.570 --> 05:14.130
So that is Section A and if we take a look at it our version it looks like this which looks pretty crappy

05:14.140 --> 05:16.780
so we're gonna add the CSX for this.

05:17.230 --> 05:26.200
So let's jump into the s code and before I start with this specific styles here let's go to our utilities

05:26.740 --> 05:32.260
and let's add in let's create our padding classes.

05:32.260 --> 05:32.650
All right.

05:32.650 --> 05:39.930
So for padding I want to have padding on the top and bottom.

05:40.300 --> 05:47.260
So we're going to use the P Y so we can actually just do class P Y and then for each one we can do like

05:47.260 --> 05:51.360
Ampersand dash one which will be p y dash one.

05:52.270 --> 06:03.550
And I'm going to set the padding to what's to one room top and bottom zero room left and right.

06:04.710 --> 06:05.240
OK.

06:05.250 --> 06:09.130
And then we can just basically just copy this down.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.830
Let's do four of them.

06:11.830 --> 06:19.750
So one two three and four second one will be two.

06:21.010 --> 06:24.220
Yeah we'll do two to three room four.

06:25.750 --> 06:26.080
All right.

06:26.080 --> 06:30.140
So if I save that and we take a look we should have some padding here.

06:30.150 --> 06:32.390
Let's check it out.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.620
Looks like we do.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.180
Well let's make sure.

06:35.180 --> 06:40.310
So yeah we can see the padding when the green and if and if you guys want to extend it a little more

06:40.310 --> 06:43.550
if you want these P three instead anything like that.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.610
Feel free to do that.

06:45.830 --> 06:51.370
Now while we're at it we might as well add some margin classes like this.

06:51.770 --> 06:58.600
And I mean if you want to put it all on one line like if you want to do that to clean it up you might.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.230
You can do that.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.430
But if you use pretty air and you save by default it's going to format it like this just to let you

07:04.430 --> 07:04.730
know.

07:05.330 --> 07:06.620
So it's do margin.

07:06.620 --> 07:15.500
This will be m y and then we're just going to change these four to margin okay.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.860
So that should be good.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.140
Let's save that.

07:22.140 --> 07:31.190
And now let's go back to our main file because now we want to target the actual home a I d.

07:31.210 --> 07:31.570
All right.

07:31.570 --> 07:36.460
So for the home styles let's put a comment in here.

07:36.490 --> 07:47.980
Let's just say home sections OK so we have a D home and let's do Ampersand dash a which will target

07:48.130 --> 07:50.530
home dash a.

07:50.530 --> 07:55.280
Now I'm going to target these specials class.

07:55.660 --> 08:00.230
And like I said I want to use the grid I'm actually going to add a little bit of margin to the top though

08:00.230 --> 08:02.650
so let's do margin top.

08:02.650 --> 08:10.430
We'll do three ram and let's do display grid.

08:10.470 --> 08:19.360
OK we're going to add a grid gap of one room and let's do our grid column.

08:19.360 --> 08:27.040
So grid dash grid dash template columns.

08:27.040 --> 08:37.090
And I'm just going to do a repeat and let's say repeat four times one fraction case will have four even

08:37.090 --> 08:41.380
columns and then the icon.

08:41.380 --> 08:47.570
I actually want to make the main color so inside specials we're going to grab the class of FAA.

08:47.590 --> 08:48.070
What is it.

08:48.070 --> 08:59.390
FAA yes because each icon has a class of FAA so let's grab on to that and let's set the color to the

08:59.420 --> 09:01.990
main color.

09:01.990 --> 09:02.330
All right.

09:02.330 --> 09:11.360
And then I'm just gonna add a padding bottom of zero point for RAM.

09:11.450 --> 09:15.300
So let's take a look at that and that looks pretty good.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.830
OK so we set this.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.450
This is the div with the class of specials.

09:20.450 --> 09:28.010
We set that to be a grid and we set template columns of repeat for 1 f fa so they're all even and then

09:28.010 --> 09:31.600
we have a grid gap of 1 RAM in between.

09:31.720 --> 09:38.480
And we change the icon colors so let's move on to the.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.910
Section B which is this part here.

09:41.600 --> 09:54.140
So jump back into our index each team L and go under the last section here and let's put a comment we'll

09:54.140 --> 09:59.420
say Section B which is basically stats.

09:59.420 --> 10:06.500
So the awards and stuff like that so we're gonna do section with the class of home Dash.

10:06.510 --> 10:15.050
B Let's do some utility classes so tech center and let's let's also do P Y too so padding on the top

10:15.050 --> 10:18.220
and bottom and then I'm going to have a class of stats.

10:18.230 --> 10:27.560
We're also going to use the grid here and let's do a div OK so each div is going to have a well and

10:27.560 --> 10:31.100
the first list item here is gonna be an icon.

10:31.160 --> 10:40.940
So let's do an I I tag with the class of FAA s and I'm going to do F A Dash users OK.

10:41.000 --> 10:52.040
And then let's do an ally with a class of stats dash title and I'm going to do clients and then let's

10:52.040 --> 10:58.440
do an ally with a class of stats dash No.

10:58.730 --> 11:02.030
And I'm gonna say 100 all right.

11:02.030 --> 11:10.020
And then I'm just gonna copy this div and we're gonna have for these as well so two three four save.

11:10.430 --> 11:16.060
And then let's go and change the second one from starting with the icon.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.900
We're gonna do FAA award.

11:19.190 --> 11:27.590
One thing I forgot is I want to make these icons bigger so we want to add FAA dash 3 x for all of these.

11:27.590 --> 11:28.930
So let's just do that.

11:32.040 --> 11:32.700
OK.

11:32.710 --> 11:39.850
And then we have FAA award changes to awards and let's say that this user or this developer has three

11:39.850 --> 11:41.440
awards.

11:41.950 --> 11:58.280
OK next one is gonna be ours worked so FAA dash our glass dash start say hours worked and let's do thirty

11:58.280 --> 11:59.170
five hundred.

12:00.890 --> 12:04.910
It's just a random number I don't know if that's a lot or a little or what.

12:04.910 --> 12:13.730
And then this icon here is gonna be FAA dash code dash branch and you can find all these in the font

12:13.760 --> 12:26.030
awesome Web site and then this is gonna be projects completed and let's do one thirty five.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.190
OK.

12:27.200 --> 12:32.810
So we'll save that lawsuit it looks like without CSF so looks absolutely horrible.

12:32.810 --> 12:42.280
So now let's go back to main dot SPSS and now we're gonna deal with with the Section B.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.390
So just like we did here.

12:44.450 --> 12:45.980
So this ends right here.

12:45.980 --> 13:01.040
We're gonna do Ampersand dash B and if you want to put comments here Home section B go up here and a

13:01.190 --> 13:04.760
home section A.

13:07.010 --> 13:13.400
So I mean you know certain people might like this way of doing it and you might not but it's it's all

13:13.400 --> 13:16.470
preference I just I'm just giving you guys the option.

13:16.880 --> 13:27.410
So let's take the stats that are in Section B class of stats and let's display a grid and let's do our

13:27.410 --> 13:42.640
grid dash template dash columns and say repeat for one FDR and you could even create functions if you're

13:42.640 --> 13:44.530
seeing the same type of patterns.

13:44.530 --> 13:50.590
You could even you know shorten this up a little more create functions extend styles things like that.

13:50.590 --> 13:54.450
So do you want to make this new this project even better.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.480
I invite you to do that.

13:56.650 --> 14:07.300
So let's take the list items and I'm going to do a line height of two for each list item.

14:07.300 --> 14:07.630
All right.

14:07.630 --> 14:13.270
And then remember some of the list items have class names such as stats titles so going to take this

14:13.330 --> 14:20.140
the list item with the class of stats dash title.

14:20.140 --> 14:26.400
And let's set the font size to one point five REM.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.320
And then we also have stats number.

14:28.330 --> 14:32.800
So let's say the list item with the class of stats

14:34.870 --> 14:37.750
dash number

14:40.900 --> 14:54.770
and let's set the font size here to to ram and let's set the font weight to bold.

14:55.090 --> 14:55.560
OK.

14:55.570 --> 15:01.860
Now if we save that and we take a look this is what it looks like.

15:01.870 --> 15:09.580
Oh you know what I think I forgot the container.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.490
Actually no we don't want a container.

15:11.490 --> 15:12.330
If we look at this.

15:12.330 --> 15:12.520
Yeah.

15:12.530 --> 15:15.360
We don't want this bound inside the container.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.260
That's right.

15:16.260 --> 15:19.950
It'll look better once we add the colors in the background.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.680
Now for the colors we're gonna use.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.430
And the child.

15:23.430 --> 15:27.120
Odd and the child even because we want light gray dark gray light gray.

15:27.510 --> 15:32.630
So remember these are all divs so we'll target.

15:32.680 --> 15:40.110
Let's see we want to go outside of say no we want to be within stats but we want to go outside of the

15:40.110 --> 15:45.060
ally which ends right here.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.890
So right here let's say div.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.770
So for each div I'm actually going to give it some padding.

15:51.780 --> 16:00.570
Let's do three room top and bottom and then we want to grab the end child on and even so we'll do Ampersand

16:00.600 --> 16:05.630
colon and we want the end child pseudo selector.

16:05.640 --> 16:16.710
We want to grab the odds and let's set the background to the light color variable.

16:16.940 --> 16:17.870
Okay.

16:18.070 --> 16:24.190
And then we'll take the Evens I'll just grab this and we'll say even.

16:24.190 --> 16:29.820
And we're gonna set that to the medium color all right.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.960
Let's take a look and there we go.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.260
So that looks pretty good.

16:36.530 --> 16:42.720
So again we have a grid with four columns and we're gonna do the response of this later on four for

16:42.750 --> 16:44.860
smartphones and stuff like that.

16:44.870 --> 16:45.050
All right.

16:45.050 --> 16:49.670
So I think I'm going to stop here in the next video we're gonna get to this part where it's a little

16:49.670 --> 16:50.120
tricky.

16:50.120 --> 16:55.790
We have our icons and then we have this positioned in a way so it kind of overlaps it.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.520
We have a transition.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.840
So we'll do that and also the footer in the next video.
