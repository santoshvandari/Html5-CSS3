00:00.390 --> 00:00.590
All right.

00:00.600 --> 00:05.610
So before we jump in and we start writing our aged hymnal and CSX for this project I just want to talk

00:05.610 --> 00:08.560
a little bit about design and ideas.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.630
So it really depends sometimes you'll get a job as a front end developer and you'll have a designer

00:15.630 --> 00:20.880
on your team that will create the you eyes and create the designs and then hand them off to you.

00:20.880 --> 00:26.700
So usually it'll be like maybe a photoshop file or a sketch file illustrator or some kind of graphic

00:26.700 --> 00:32.970
design program and then it's your job to take that design and use each team Alan CSX and possibly some

00:32.970 --> 00:40.840
javascript to recreate that seed so that it actually runs in the browser as a Web site or a web app.

00:40.860 --> 00:46.290
Now a lot of the times you don't have the luxury of having a designer you'll have to actually create

00:46.290 --> 00:51.690
everything come up with the ideas on your own especially if you're doing freelancing where you do absolutely

00:51.690 --> 00:52.740
everything.

00:52.740 --> 00:59.160
So what I usually do is I look at other Web sites and other themes for inspiration and a good way to

00:59.160 --> 01:01.260
do that is to search like theme sites.

01:01.260 --> 01:08.010
So for instance bootstrap has a lot of really nice themes bootstrap is actually a framework in each

01:08.010 --> 01:09.640
team LCROSS framework.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.590
I have an entire course in bootstrap if you want to learn more about it.

01:12.870 --> 01:18.690
But let's say we search for bootstrap themes and there's going to be all types of sites that have different

01:19.020 --> 01:19.710
themes.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.260
Let's just go to this one here.

01:21.270 --> 01:26.730
Themes dot get bootstrap dot com and we go down here and you can see some examples some of them are

01:26.730 --> 01:30.790
Web sites and some are like admin interfaces like this.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.670
That's not really what we're interested right now.

01:32.670 --> 01:37.860
But let's take this site for example and this is actually selling for 50 dollars and that that's another

01:37.860 --> 01:42.990
idea for you guys if you get good at this after this course and you can create some decent layouts you

01:42.990 --> 01:50.740
can actually sell them online but most of these sites have a live preview so let's take a look at that.

01:50.770 --> 01:55.060
So what I would do is I would take a look at this layout and I would just get some ideas.

01:55.060 --> 01:56.250
So look at the header.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.970
Look at how things are laid out how the logo looks.

01:59.080 --> 02:05.530
The background image K so that's that's really the what's popular right now is to have the main large

02:05.560 --> 02:11.740
image with just a little bit of text and maybe some buttons and then underneath that have some boxes

02:12.100 --> 02:13.930
and you'll see that over and over.

02:13.960 --> 02:20.200
And that's really what's in right now it's to keep it very clean you know not not crazy colors just

02:20.200 --> 02:27.100
maybe you know to two or maybe three colors with some light grays and in some dark colors but it's pretty

02:27.100 --> 02:33.730
simple and down here we have some demo pages like the services page which again we just have a large

02:33.730 --> 02:36.570
background with some with some text over it.

02:36.650 --> 02:42.310
If we go down we have three boxes with some icons so icons are really big.

02:42.310 --> 02:46.490
Down here you can see just have some text images laid out.

02:46.930 --> 02:50.580
There's some animation in this theme but you know of course you don't need to add the animation.

02:50.590 --> 02:53.050
I'm actually not a fan of a lot of animation.

02:53.170 --> 02:58.750
And again just icons and text just like we have right here so you'll see this over and over.

02:58.750 --> 03:05.140
So just go to different theme sites and get some ideas get some inspiration and don't copy them I'm

03:05.140 --> 03:11.500
not saying just you know take exactly what they did and redo it but take in some of the ideas from maybe

03:11.500 --> 03:16.450
four or five different themes and create something of your own so that that's what I do that's how I

03:16.450 --> 03:23.710
create my web sites and user interfaces I'm far from a graphic designer but I think I have at least

03:23.830 --> 03:27.360
some some eye for design and it's not that hard.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.940
Just take some some examples for inspiration.

03:30.970 --> 03:31.260
All right.

03:31.270 --> 03:35.200
So that said I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about that before we get started.

03:35.230 --> 03:38.320
So in the next video we're going to start to write our age Tamil.
