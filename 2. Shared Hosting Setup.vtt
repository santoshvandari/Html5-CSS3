00:00.310 --> 00:06.240
All right guys so we're going to deploy our site to a shared host with In Motion hosting which is a

00:06.240 --> 00:09.060
service that I've used for a long time.

00:09.090 --> 00:10.810
I'm actually going to create a new account.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.390
They're not paying me a dime for this.

00:12.390 --> 00:18.420
However I do have an affiliate link that I'll attach in a document to this lecture so if you are going

00:18.420 --> 00:22.290
to buy a package I'd appreciate it if you could use that link.

00:22.290 --> 00:22.550
All right.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.420
So I'm actually going to go ahead and set up an account just out of pocket just to demonstrate this

00:27.420 --> 00:27.810
to you.

00:27.810 --> 00:32.970
So as you can see there's different types of hosting they offer many of them are the types we've talked

00:32.970 --> 00:33.690
about.

00:33.690 --> 00:37.590
Now they're shared hosting plans are going to be the business hosting.

00:37.650 --> 00:41.300
You'll notice with different companies though they'll call it different things.

00:41.340 --> 00:46.140
They also have WordPress hosting which is basically the business hosting or shared hosting.

00:46.140 --> 00:51.440
But with Wordpress already pre configured WordPress is actually a content management system.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.040
And it might be something worth looking into after this course.

00:55.140 --> 00:59.290
They also a hosting dedicated servers reseller hosting.

00:59.340 --> 01:03.010
We're going to go ahead and click on learn more for business hosting.

01:03.090 --> 01:08.220
So as you can see if you choose any type of hosting that you're going to have additional packages with

01:08.220 --> 01:14.330
different price points and these prices here are actually if you paid for two years in advance three

01:14.330 --> 01:17.350
ninety nine you'll see one year for ninety nine.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.670
This one is one year six ninety nine.

01:19.770 --> 01:25.620
So very rarely if ever are you going to find a hosting company that allows you to actually pay three

01:25.620 --> 01:28.310
dollars and ninety nine cents a month by month.

01:28.410 --> 01:32.610
Usually you have to pay by year by two years sometimes they'll allow six months.

01:32.610 --> 01:34.730
It really depends on the company.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.010
But for now we're going to choose or I'm going to choose the cheapest version here for one year.

01:41.010 --> 01:45.900
Now the difference between these you can see is the number of Web sites so you can have different amounts

01:45.900 --> 01:46.590
of Web sites.

01:46.590 --> 01:51.930
The disk space and bandwidth is unlimited on all of these but you have to be careful with shared hosting

01:51.930 --> 01:53.450
even though it says Unlimited.

01:53.610 --> 01:57.420
If you start to slow the server down you start to slow down resources.

01:57.430 --> 02:02.550
They're either going to throttle you or they're going to ask you to bump up your package if you have

02:03.410 --> 02:10.680
a Web site that has a ton of users or it's a really big or big application something like that then

02:10.710 --> 02:14.770
you're going to want to use a VPN or dedicated server or something like that.

02:14.940 --> 02:19.020
But like I said most small business Web sites these are absolutely fine.

02:19.020 --> 02:24.480
I would probably say go with the middle tier but since I'm I'm just doing this for the course I'm going

02:24.480 --> 02:30.210
to choose the cheapest one available which is going to be one year for four ninety nine per month which

02:30.210 --> 02:32.640
should come to about 60 dollars a year

02:35.460 --> 02:36.320
yes.

02:36.340 --> 02:43.780
Now if you want an SSL certificate they do offer free SSL but you do have to have a dedicated IP for

02:43.780 --> 02:48.790
that which is an additional four dollars a month which is 48 dollars.

02:48.880 --> 02:55.690
So they're going to charge you an extra 48 dollars if you want a dedicated IP and an SSL I'm not going

02:55.690 --> 03:00.280
to choose that but just know that you will need to if you want SSL.

03:00.670 --> 03:06.820
And then here this is for just like a quick starter one page Web site for 100 bucks obviously we don't

03:06.820 --> 03:08.120
want that.

03:08.320 --> 03:12.580
And then if we want to install Wordpress or bold grid we could do that but we're not going to do that

03:12.580 --> 03:13.300
either.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.800
So let's click continue.

03:14.800 --> 03:21.310
And now it's going to ask about a domain now within motion you can purchase a domain through them.

03:21.340 --> 03:26.950
I think it's fourteen ninety nine per year or if you have your own you could choose this option here

03:27.280 --> 03:32.530
enter your domain and then you would have to go wherever you registered that domain and just update

03:32.560 --> 03:40.050
what's called name servers to point to you're in motion hosting account for just registering domains.

03:40.060 --> 03:43.060
I actually suggest name cheap dot com.

03:43.060 --> 03:48.550
I'll put an affiliate link for named cheap in the document as well but I'm just going to go ahead and

03:48.550 --> 03:50.350
purchase a new domain here.

03:50.470 --> 03:58.160
So I'm going to do edge ledger and I believe dot com is already taken but dot net is not.

03:58.150 --> 04:02.890
So I'm going to just choose edge ledger dot net as my domain.

04:02.890 --> 04:03.090
OK.

04:03.100 --> 04:09.620
So as you can see it's available so I'm going to add it to my cart and then over here you can see my

04:09.620 --> 04:17.480
total is eighty four eighty six that's for the entire year for the domain and for the hosting and let's

04:18.000 --> 04:19.100
continue here.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.840
I'm going to remove the domain privacy what that means is if someone tries to do a who is check on your

04:24.840 --> 04:29.880
domain they won't be able to see your like the e-mail address you used and stuff like that but I don't

04:29.880 --> 04:30.620
care about that.

04:30.690 --> 04:32.820
So I'll delete that.

04:32.820 --> 04:38.400
And then over here I am a returning customer but I want to create a whole new identity for this just

04:38.400 --> 04:40.780
because this is only for the course.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.500
So I'll go ahead and put an email address in here

04:48.160 --> 04:49.080
and continue

04:54.580 --> 05:00.070
and then it's probably going to take me to a page or I've to enter my credit card information and stuff

05:00.070 --> 05:00.730
like that.

05:01.150 --> 05:01.390
Yeah.

05:01.420 --> 05:02.460
All my information.

05:02.460 --> 05:07.390
So what I'm going to do is positive video I'm going to fill all this out and then I'll come back.

05:07.960 --> 05:08.280
All right.

05:08.290 --> 05:14.290
So I filled out all my information it gave me a summary up here so now I just need to click agree and

05:14.290 --> 05:14.860
check out

05:21.990 --> 05:22.250
OK.

05:22.290 --> 05:26.020
So now it says welcome to IN MOTION hosting order details.

05:26.040 --> 05:31.860
And down here it's gonna ask if we were creating a new Web site or transferring an existing web site.

05:31.950 --> 05:35.850
So we're gonna go ahead and click creating a new Web site.

05:35.940 --> 05:42.360
And they also ask if you want a one on one call from a new account specialist so someone that can actually

05:42.360 --> 05:44.090
call you and help you out if you need help.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.320
Which I think is really cool.

05:45.330 --> 05:47.010
But obviously when we're gonna click.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.620
No thanks.

05:48.630 --> 05:54.570
And then here they have really good documentation and support for you know the control panel setting

05:54.570 --> 05:56.750
up FCP accounts and stuff like that.

05:56.850 --> 06:02.940
And you can get custom articles sent to you but I'm not going to check any of these so we'll just leave

06:02.940 --> 06:03.930
them all blank.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.740
Well I guess we have to check at least one.

06:05.910 --> 06:07.510
So we'll do.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.330
Let's do the getting started

06:14.690 --> 06:15.130
OK.

06:15.140 --> 06:17.350
So it's going to process that.

06:17.420 --> 06:24.260
Now we should have an e-mail that has information on how to access our C panel our control panel and

06:24.260 --> 06:25.370
stuff like that.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.140
So I'm going to just pause the video and pull up that e-mail.

06:30.180 --> 06:30.450
All right.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.430
So this is the e-mail that you'll get.

06:32.430 --> 06:37.950
Welcome to emotion hosting and it's going to say get started with your account management panel also

06:37.950 --> 06:38.780
called.

06:39.060 --> 06:44.340
So your e-mail your log in is going to be your e-mail address and then it says to get started set your

06:44.340 --> 06:45.360
password here.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.890
So we're gonna go ahead and click that.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.840
We're gonna set a password.

06:49.170 --> 06:55.140
So you actually need something different here.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.200
All right.

07:02.220 --> 07:08.990
So that might be too simple.

07:09.110 --> 07:10.980
I'm gonna be cancelling this account anyways.

07:10.990 --> 07:11.300
All right.

07:11.660 --> 07:18.740
So this is your amp panel and this is this is basically in Motion's customer panel you can update your

07:18.740 --> 07:25.610
contact information your credit card info if you have trouble you can send in a support ticket and then

07:25.610 --> 07:32.600
down here you have your link to see panel which is basically your web hosting control panel and many

07:32.600 --> 07:39.080
many different companies you see panel it's the most popular type of control panel for managed hosting.

07:39.110 --> 07:44.060
You can also check your e-mail from here but you can also do that from C panel.

07:44.150 --> 07:49.490
You can install software like WordPress stuff like that you can manage your SSL certificates.

07:49.490 --> 07:50.530
So it's basically your.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.040
Your client panel.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.900
So let's go ahead and click on C. panel.

07:53.900 --> 07:57.470
And that should open up and let's just close this up.

07:58.040 --> 08:04.100
So this is your control panel for your basically your Web site your hosting account and you'll see there's

08:04.100 --> 08:09.020
different sections preferences we have a lot of the stuff that we have in the HAMP panel like contact

08:09.020 --> 08:14.580
information and to get back to amp you can click here or you can go click home.

08:14.660 --> 08:20.240
There's also links up here to get to different sections but e-mail you have your e-mail accounts you

08:20.240 --> 08:26.990
can set up your forwarders your email routing if spam filtering stuff like that domains if you wanted

08:26.990 --> 08:32.630
to add another domain if you want to create redirects you can do that from here if you want to install

08:32.630 --> 08:39.450
applications on your Web site like WordPress which is a blog slash CNS content management system you'll

08:39.460 --> 08:45.590
sort of like shopping carts open cart press to shop these are open source shopping carts that you can

08:45.590 --> 08:47.590
install and use on your Web site.

08:47.810 --> 08:55.190
You have software so PDP packages stuff like that files FCP accounts we're going to get into that because

08:55.190 --> 09:02.540
we need a way to actually upload our files to our site and databases if you get into application development.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.980
You probably want to get into like my as well or Postgres.

09:06.080 --> 09:12.140
These are relational databases and these are included as well metrics if you want to look at analytics

09:12.170 --> 09:19.700
your Web site visitors and so on security you can block certain IP addresses you do you have Shell access

09:19.700 --> 09:24.910
which means you can log in through the terminal into your account and do different things in advance

09:24.920 --> 09:28.970
we have things like cron jobs but that's way beyond this course.

09:28.970 --> 09:29.480
All right.

09:29.600 --> 09:34.460
And on the right side I mean I have mine blurred out just because this is sensitive information but

09:34.460 --> 09:39.680
it has all your stats and stuff like that the number of FCP accounts you use and email accounts and

09:39.680 --> 09:40.590
so on.

09:40.610 --> 09:47.390
So in the next video before we start to deploy our Web site I want to show you how to create email accounts

09:47.480 --> 09:49.490
as well as FTE accounts.
