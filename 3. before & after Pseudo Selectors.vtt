00:00.440 --> 00:05.790
All right guys in this video we're gonna take a look at the before and after pseudo selector which actually

00:05.790 --> 00:09.990
allows us to insert content before or after an element.

00:10.350 --> 00:19.700
So gonna create a new file here called 0 3 underscore before underscore after dot age GMO and let's

00:19.710 --> 00:22.700
put our boilerplate in here.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.060
Say before and after.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.630
OK.

00:30.900 --> 00:35.670
So like I said it allows us to put something before and after and I'm gonna give you some practical

00:35.670 --> 00:36.300
examples.

00:36.300 --> 00:44.010
So one example would be where we have a form and there's some fields that are required and you may have

00:44.010 --> 00:49.770
seen this before but they'll be like some kind of mark like an asterisk or something where the fields

00:49.770 --> 00:50.880
are actually required.

00:50.880 --> 01:01.260
So what I'm gonna do is just put in a label and we'll just say for name and I'm going to give this a

01:01.260 --> 01:06.710
class of is Dash required.

01:06.710 --> 01:07.250
OK.

01:07.260 --> 01:18.000
And then here I'll just say name and then after the label we'll put an input type text that sets that

01:18.030 --> 01:19.300
we don't need anything else.

01:19.350 --> 01:20.930
So let's say this and open it

01:24.060 --> 01:32.460
so a good example of a practical use for this would be to put an asterisk after the label like right

01:32.460 --> 01:36.190
here and we could even style it we could color it read for instance.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.270
So let's take our is required class.

01:39.270 --> 01:45.200
So we'll say what we want what is required.

01:45.750 --> 01:54.030
And so I want to do is required and then we want to do colon after I wanted to be after.

01:54.120 --> 02:02.100
And then in here it takes in a Val property called content which I'm going to make an asterisk.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.310
So we're just going to put loops wrong character.

02:05.310 --> 02:09.510
I'm going to put an asterisk in here and let's just save that and see what happens.

02:09.960 --> 02:15.750
So I noticed that the actress actually gets put in here and in it's it's not in the markup if we open

02:15.750 --> 02:23.820
up our our Deb tools here and we go to the elements tab and we take a look at the label see we want

02:23.820 --> 02:28.770
to look at the each team also going to just bring this down if you look at the label we have a label

02:28.770 --> 02:32.090
and then input There's no asterisk in the markup at all.

02:32.100 --> 02:39.060
It's being inserted into the brought into the view here in the browser through CSX and then we can also

02:39.060 --> 02:47.550
style it we should have a semicolon here but we can style it we could say like color red and I saved

02:47.550 --> 02:53.300
that it's now red we might want to push it over a little so we can add some padding dash left we'll

02:53.310 --> 02:59.550
say like two pixels and save and it pushes it over so that I think that's a pretty practical use because

02:59.550 --> 03:02.490
then you can go ahead and just give any.

03:02.500 --> 03:07.560
Like let's say we had you know six seven fields whatever ones were required you could simply give a

03:07.560 --> 03:12.380
class of is required and it would have would automatically have this asterisk.

03:12.390 --> 03:18.990
You don't have to worry about going into your markup and actually adding an asterisk in your each team.

03:19.200 --> 03:19.520
OK.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.720
So that's one practical use.

03:21.720 --> 03:27.930
And just to show you if I did before and save it does the same thing it just puts it before.

03:28.170 --> 03:36.020
Now another really practical use for before is to do an overlay in an image overlay.

03:36.030 --> 03:44.460
Now we did an overlay in the edge ledger project but we didn't use before we just kind of did it on

03:44.460 --> 03:45.230
that element.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.980
But I'm going to I'm going to give you an example of how we would do this.

03:49.050 --> 03:52.100
I'm going to comment this so we don't want this element.

03:52.110 --> 04:00.060
We're gonna do kind of a little landing page here so let's put a header and in the header we'll do an

04:00.100 --> 04:12.990
H1 will say hello world to a paragraph I'll do Lorem 10 and then under that header let's do a section

04:14.430 --> 04:22.740
and we'll put an H three I'll just say Lorem three and then we'll do a paragraph and let's do Lorem

04:22.970 --> 04:24.070
30.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.930
Okay so we'll save that.

04:26.190 --> 04:31.000
And I'm actually going to bring this back down to 100 percent I did have this zoomed in.

04:31.460 --> 04:38.940
It's going to bring that back down and then let's add some some core styles so I'm going to add some

04:38.940 --> 04:43.940
styles to the body just I wanted to look somewhat decent and realistic.

04:43.950 --> 04:51.680
So it's a font family well to use aerial for our font and let's give it a background.

04:51.770 --> 04:59.600
We're given the body of background of dark and a color of white all right.

04:59.620 --> 05:07.720
And then for the header itself scoring here will see a header.

05:07.750 --> 05:08.980
I'm gonna display

05:11.500 --> 05:16.870
as flex as soon as I do that it's gonna it's gonna go horizontal.

05:16.870 --> 05:23.500
But we want the Flex direction to be a column case.

05:23.550 --> 05:28.910
I save that it goes back to that direction and we want to justify content center.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.590
I just want to move everything to the center.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.150
So this is stuff we've already done.

05:33.150 --> 05:34.400
We're just setting it up.

05:34.430 --> 05:44.250
So we want to align items to the center and we want to text align to the center as well.

05:44.250 --> 05:50.850
And then let's let's add a height of one hundred viewport height so we'll save that.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.200
Good.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.160
The font size of the H1 I just want to increase.

05:55.160 --> 06:01.890
So I going to see a header each one.

06:01.980 --> 06:08.880
Now we could use if you want you can use greater then it doesn't really make a difference but sometimes

06:08.880 --> 06:11.740
you'll see that they'll see that people like to do that.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.150
Which means that it's a direct child of header.

06:16.200 --> 06:29.940
So let's say font size for RAM and let's say margin 1 RAM and I'm just gonna mark zero at the margin

06:31.560 --> 06:37.620
on the body as well so I'm going to take an image and first of all I'm going to add it to just just

06:37.620 --> 06:41.920
the header itself and I'm going to show you with the problem with that is.

06:42.000 --> 06:52.630
So let's get an image from source dot on Splash dot com and if you go down see.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.370
From a collection.

06:54.410 --> 06:58.160
Let's do this random search term for grab this.

06:58.160 --> 07:10.480
This nature water random search term and let's put a background of your URL.

07:11.060 --> 07:14.940
Put that in there and say no repeat because we don't want it to repeat.

07:14.960 --> 07:20.090
We want to center on the x and y axis and then we want it to cover the hole we want to show the whole

07:20.090 --> 07:20.840
image.

07:20.930 --> 07:25.040
So I save that we get a picture of some water here.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.020
Now I want the I.

07:28.100 --> 07:36.140
This is actually nice because we can read the text fine but a lot of times with with some images you

07:36.140 --> 07:38.330
won't be able to read the text.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.820
These all seem to be pretty good.

07:40.370 --> 07:41.780
All right so let's use this one.

07:41.780 --> 07:50.420
So let's say that we want this image to be transparent we want to add opacity value and we could see

07:50.420 --> 07:53.150
like zero point four and save.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.000
And the image is gonna change but you can see that now we can see through the image and it makes it

07:59.000 --> 08:04.330
darker but the text is also translucent and we can also see through that.

08:04.340 --> 08:07.450
And it's also not readable still.

08:07.490 --> 08:14.630
So we want the text to be nice and clear but only the background image to be faded or to be translucent

08:14.690 --> 08:15.630
loosing.

08:15.650 --> 08:19.970
So what we need to do here what we could do as a solution is use before.

08:19.990 --> 08:28.590
So we're gonna say header before and we're gonna take this right here.

08:28.670 --> 08:34.730
The background image and the opacity value and pass it in there.

08:34.730 --> 08:39.770
Now when you use before and after you want to use content now we're not actually inserting content in

08:39.770 --> 08:44.840
the page so we're just going to leave this blank like that right.

08:44.850 --> 08:51.540
Now if I save that we can't see the image because we basically need to position it so that it's it's

08:51.690 --> 08:56.280
it's basically on top of it or actually behind it.

08:56.670 --> 09:05.820
So we want to position this let's say position absolute we want to start at the top corner so top 0

09:05.820 --> 09:07.820
left 0.

09:07.980 --> 09:08.240
OK.

09:08.250 --> 09:14.790
So basically right here we want it to go 100 percent across 100 percent height because we wanted to

09:14.790 --> 09:22.220
cover the whole thing so let's say with 100 percent in height also 100 percent.

09:23.250 --> 09:30.730
So if we go ahead and save that you can see that the we're still having the same issue.

09:30.750 --> 09:34.280
I mean the image is dark but the text is not.

09:34.290 --> 09:40.830
So we're gonna actually give it a z index and we're gonna push it behind.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.340
So we're gonna say negative 1 and let's save.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.130
And now look at the text it's nice and bright.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.050
Yet the image is still darkened.

09:49.110 --> 09:55.530
OK so if we wanted to change the the amount of opacity we could make it darker the even darker than

09:55.530 --> 10:01.460
this like zero point two zero is gonna be completely just dark.

10:01.460 --> 10:02.710
OK.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.570
And then one is gonna be just the full image.

10:05.580 --> 10:09.610
Anything in between we can do like zero point five.

10:09.660 --> 10:12.390
It's kind of hard because the image keeps changing.

10:12.390 --> 10:17.430
You'd probably be a better example if it was a static image I probably should have did that but either

10:17.430 --> 10:22.010
way you can see how this works so we're adding the background image on the.

10:22.050 --> 10:29.820
Before pseudo selector adding some opacity positioning and absolute starting it at the top left making

10:29.820 --> 10:35.060
sure it covers the whole area and then we're sending it back with the index of negative one.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.000
That will bring the text forward.

10:37.020 --> 10:37.310
OK.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.960
So just remember that when you when you're doing a showcase image you can do it that way.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.290
All right.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.690
So that's a pretty practical use of this and you'll see this a lot.

10:46.740 --> 10:50.370
So in the next video we're gonna start to take a look at box shadows.
