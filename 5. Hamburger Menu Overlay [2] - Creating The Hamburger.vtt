WEBVTT

00:00.350 --> 00:05.850
All right guys so I know the last video is kind of long but I wanted to get the H team L and the base

00:05.850 --> 00:10.440
styling out of the way so we can focus on the menu so let's head over to our version which looks like

00:10.440 --> 00:11.150
this.

00:11.220 --> 00:17.640
We just have a checkbox up here and the check box has a class of toggle or if you remember so we have

00:18.620 --> 00:25.650
class of toddler menu wrap is going to cover it's going to surround everything OK including the overlay

00:25.770 --> 00:28.740
so menu wrap surrounds all of this everything.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.090
So let's start with that.

00:30.120 --> 00:38.460
So we're going to go to menu CSX and let's add class menu dash wrap and we're gonna set that to position

00:38.460 --> 00:39.840
fixed.

00:39.840 --> 00:47.250
So when we have our overlay open and we scroll down I don't we don't want this to scroll down like we

00:47.250 --> 00:53.280
don't want the the menu to just go out of focus or out of the viewport we want it to stay where it is.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.210
So we want to position it fixed at top 0 left 0.

00:59.280 --> 01:05.550
So basically its natural position we want it to stay there and we want to give it a z index of 1 so

01:05.550 --> 01:06.780
that it's always on top.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.370
We want the menu to be visible.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.410
So we want it to be on top of any other content.

01:11.430 --> 01:11.760
All right.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.860
So I save that.

01:12.870 --> 01:19.170
Now you can see that it's fixed in that white area is now gone because it's just sitting on top of anything

01:19.170 --> 01:20.910
else that we have on the page.

01:20.910 --> 01:23.690
Now let me try and explain what's going to happen.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.960
We need to style the checkbox itself.

01:27.030 --> 01:31.320
Now the checkbox is going to sit on top of the actual hamburger class.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.920
This right here we wanted to sit on top of it.

01:33.930 --> 01:39.480
However we want it to be invisible so we want to set the opacity to 0 0.

01:39.540 --> 01:45.060
And the reason that we need the checkbox is just for its state because we can set it to checked and

01:45.060 --> 01:50.490
we can actually grab on to that within the style and we can create our overlay when it's checked and

01:50.490 --> 01:57.170
when it's unchecked we can bring it out so that the the the checkbox is just for functionality the hamburger

01:57.180 --> 02:03.570
class is what we're gonna use to create the actual square and then the D INNER div will be using to

02:03.570 --> 02:05.700
create the lines inside.

02:05.700 --> 02:05.910
OK.

02:05.910 --> 02:08.340
Hopefully that makes sense and close that up.

02:08.520 --> 02:16.770
So let's grab the menu wrap and then the toddler which is the actual checkbox input and we need to position

02:16.770 --> 02:26.910
it correctly so we're gonna say position absolute and we want to set it to the top corner so top 0 left

02:27.290 --> 02:28.390
0.

02:28.740 --> 02:38.300
And we're gonna set let's see we're gonna set the z index to 2 because we always want it to be on top.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.630
It's gonna be invisible we won't see it but it will still be there and we'll still be able to check

02:42.630 --> 02:49.020
it and we're gonna set the cursor to pointer so that when we hover over it we have a pointer and let's

02:49.020 --> 02:56.880
set the width to say 50 pixels in height we'll do 50 pixels.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.750
And if I save that you can see now it's positioned absolute right in the corner.

03:00.750 --> 03:06.100
However we don't want it to show so we're gonna say opacity and let's set that to zero.

03:06.370 --> 03:09.720
OK so now it's not there but it is there.

03:09.780 --> 03:10.140
All right.

03:10.140 --> 03:15.300
And you can see I'm actually checking it right now when I hover over it the cursor goes over it and

03:15.300 --> 03:19.500
it's gonna be 50 pixels around all right.

03:20.330 --> 03:24.980
Now the hamburger class we're going to we're going to grab on to that next.

03:24.980 --> 03:31.220
So let's say hamburger and we're going to position it right in the same spot.

03:31.250 --> 03:37.760
So absolute top zero left zero.

03:37.850 --> 03:43.530
And we're gonna set this Zi index to one.

03:44.260 --> 03:44.640
OK.

03:44.730 --> 03:51.700
We want it to be under the checkbox and we're also going to set a width and height.

03:51.780 --> 03:55.320
We're gonna do 60 pixels so high.

03:55.330 --> 03:57.830
And you can mess with the sizes if you want.

03:57.870 --> 04:07.960
I mean you don't have to follow the exact parameters that I am but loops let's see we get width height.

04:08.110 --> 04:13.970
Let's set padding to one room and then the background.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.050
I'm going to set to the primary color.

04:17.050 --> 04:20.920
Now I just want to show you real quick if I do like background black and save.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.370
We get our little square here and we can actually check it.

04:24.370 --> 04:27.520
I'm clicking and it's checking that input.

04:27.610 --> 04:27.900
OK.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.290
But we're seeing the hamburger class here now.

04:31.300 --> 04:35.780
I'm setting it to the primary colors so far.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.240
Dash dash primary.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.860
We're not going to get the little drop down in B.S. code because the variables are not set in this file

04:41.860 --> 04:43.300
their sentence style file.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.210
So it's a primary color.

04:46.210 --> 04:53.020
And if I save you'll see that it has the primary color and it's see through it it's translucent because

04:53.500 --> 05:01.750
of the primary the primary color is an RGA and the opacity is one point seventy five.

05:01.750 --> 05:07.570
So that's what we're seeing here I mean if you don't want it if you want to set it to a different color

05:07.570 --> 05:09.360
you don't want it to be translucent.

05:09.370 --> 05:13.570
Then of course you can change the background to whatever you want.

05:13.570 --> 05:23.230
Now I'm also going I want to center on a display this as a flex because the div inside is going to take

05:23.230 --> 05:24.690
care of the lines.

05:24.820 --> 05:33.280
I want to center everything so when a display flexed and then a line the items to the center and let's

05:33.280 --> 05:40.570
also justify the content to the center and we should be good.

05:41.110 --> 05:41.440
All right.

05:41.460 --> 05:45.640
So that's basically the the hamburger the outside wrapper of the hamburger.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.490
Now we want to do the lines.

05:47.660 --> 05:48.060
OK.

05:48.070 --> 05:48.930
And remember there isn't.

05:48.940 --> 05:54.010
There's a div inside of the hamburger div.

05:54.040 --> 06:00.310
So what we want to do is set this to be a line and then we're going to use before and after to insert

06:01.720 --> 06:03.510
the top and bottom lines.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.080
OK if that makes sense.

06:05.140 --> 06:09.940
So let's go back to menu CSX and I'll actually put a comment here.

06:09.940 --> 06:14.230
Let's say hamburger line just so you know what does what.

06:14.230 --> 06:20.890
Because I know a lot of times when we look at complicated CSX is you don't know you know what is actually

06:20.890 --> 06:21.490
doing what.

06:21.490 --> 06:24.610
So I want to try to explain that as we go along.

06:24.820 --> 06:31.420
So we're going to take the menu wrap and we want the hamburger class and then we want the immediate

06:31.450 --> 06:39.720
div and we're going to set it to position relative.

06:39.910 --> 06:47.290
And then we're going to set flex to none and set the width to 100 percent.

06:47.440 --> 06:47.830
OK.

06:47.830 --> 06:52.290
Now the height I'm going to set to two pixels because remember we're creating the line here.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.080
We're creating the middle line of the hamburger menu.

06:55.150 --> 06:59.370
So I'm going to give it a background of white.

06:59.460 --> 07:06.680
I want it to be white and let's say display flex.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.130
And we want to set a line

07:11.880 --> 07:19.280
items to center and justify content to center.

07:19.280 --> 07:23.160
So let's save that and you can see we get our middle line.

07:23.320 --> 07:23.660
OK.

07:23.670 --> 07:28.770
Now obviously we need to more we need one above it or I should say before it and after it.

07:28.790 --> 07:33.500
So we're gonna use the before and after pseudo selectors.

07:33.500 --> 07:42.030
So let's say hamburger lines I will say top and bottom lines.

07:42.290 --> 07:47.400
So we're going to take menu wrap.

07:48.290 --> 07:53.750
Hamburger and let's say we want the div that we want to do before.

07:53.990 --> 08:00.160
So when you use the before sudo selector and we don't we're going to do the same exact styling for after.

08:00.170 --> 08:06.320
So when I copy this and then we're gonna do after and it might turn if you're using V as code it might

08:06.320 --> 08:07.910
turn into double colon.

08:08.210 --> 08:12.950
Basically does the same thing a single Colon is just a shortcut for that.

08:12.950 --> 08:19.600
So since we're using before and after we need to put in content but we're not actually inserting content.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.320
Let's set this to position

08:23.900 --> 08:31.090
absolute K and it's absolute to the relative div the actual div.

08:32.010 --> 08:32.330
Right.

08:32.360 --> 08:43.350
And then let's set the z index to one and let's say top say negative 10 pixels so I'm going to move

08:43.350 --> 08:48.600
it up 10 pixels and we want to set the width to 100 percent.

08:48.600 --> 08:55.320
Just like the the standard div appear and then we're going to set the height to the same thing.

08:55.320 --> 09:03.950
So two pixels and for a background I'm just gonna say inherit which will be white.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.840
It's going to inherit the this white here.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.860
So if I save that you'll see that now we have a line up above.

09:10.860 --> 09:14.970
Now what's happening is both the before and after.

09:14.970 --> 09:19.750
It's basically creating both lines the before and after however they're in the same exact spot.

09:19.890 --> 09:23.070
We just said top negative 10 pixels.

09:23.070 --> 09:27.270
So what I want to do now is just take the after one OK.

09:27.570 --> 09:29.880
Because this is this should all be the same for both.

09:29.880 --> 09:35.040
However the after we just want to position it below so I'm simply going to take the top value and I'm

09:35.040 --> 09:38.010
going to set it to 10 pixels and save.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.530
And now that brings it down 10 pixels.

09:41.250 --> 09:41.510
OK.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.950
So hopefully that makes sense.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.780
And now we have our our hamburger menu.

09:45.870 --> 09:46.170
All right.

09:46.170 --> 09:51.040
So just to reiterate what we've done here because I know that it might be a little confusing.

09:51.330 --> 09:57.960
We set the menu wrap to be positioned fixed and start at the top and top the top left corner.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.490
So menu wrap covers everything even the entire overlay here.

10:02.490 --> 10:08.790
And then the toddler is the checkbox which we position did we set a width and height and then we basically

10:08.790 --> 10:10.410
made it disappear.

10:10.470 --> 10:11.790
It's still there.

10:11.790 --> 10:13.380
You can see we can still check it.

10:13.410 --> 10:16.440
So right now I'm actually checking it if I click anywhere on this.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.620
It's checking it but it is opacity 0.

10:19.620 --> 10:25.390
In fact if I change this back to 1 and we save you can see that it's still there.

10:25.410 --> 10:25.650
All right.

10:25.660 --> 10:30.960
We're going to set that back to zero and then the hamburger class is what takes care of this actual

10:30.960 --> 10:32.640
box right here.

10:32.640 --> 10:32.880
OK.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.100
Which we have set the primary color you kind of care.

10:35.160 --> 10:41.880
Yeah I mean it's very hard to see because it's it's it's it's translucent and it it's almost the same

10:41.880 --> 10:44.190
color as the background but it is there.

10:44.190 --> 10:49.610
And then the inner div we took and we create basically created a line.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.160
So we set with to 100 percent.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.720
So goes all the way across.

10:54.720 --> 11:01.260
Aside from the padding and the height to two pixels so the line is two pixel then we took the before

11:01.290 --> 11:09.780
and after pseudo selectors and we created two more lines for those and set it to be up here the top

11:09.810 --> 11:16.170
negative 10 pixels and then we took just the after and we changed top to ten pixels so that it got pushed

11:16.170 --> 11:17.160
down.

11:17.160 --> 11:17.480
OK.

11:17.490 --> 11:21.200
So that's that's what's going on here and hopefully that makes sense.

11:21.210 --> 11:26.910
So I think that's gonna be it for this video in the next one I want to start to take care of the rotation

11:26.910 --> 11:28.170
when we click on this.

11:28.260 --> 11:35.280
I want to transform it and use rotate so that we can actually more fit into an X. case we're going to

11:35.280 --> 11:36.510
do that in the next video.
