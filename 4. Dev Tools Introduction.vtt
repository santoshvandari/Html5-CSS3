WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:00.630
All right.

00:00.630 --> 00:06.680
So before we get into CSX properties and stuff like that I want to take a break from from the East Coast

00:06.850 --> 00:10.080
and just go into Google and take a look at the dev tools.

00:10.080 --> 00:15.870
Now if you're not using Google if you're using Firefox or Safari those also have developer tools and

00:15.870 --> 00:20.250
they have all they can do all this stuff we're gonna do in this video you just might have to look up

00:20.520 --> 00:24.240
the shortcut to get to them or the menu item to get to them.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.120
So in Chrome if you're on Windows you can hit F 12.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.880
That should open them if you're on a Mac.

00:28.890 --> 00:34.750
You can do option option command I and that will also open them.

00:34.830 --> 00:40.590
And it's also in the menu so if you go up here and you go to more tools I know you guys can't see it

00:40.620 --> 00:46.020
but off to the right there's a developer tools option and I can click that and that will also open them

00:46.020 --> 00:46.980
up.

00:46.980 --> 00:52.770
So there's a lot of tabs here and this did they're very powerful we can see network connections we have

00:52.770 --> 00:56.160
a javascript console there's all types of stuff we can do here.

00:56.250 --> 01:01.470
But what we want to focus on is the elements tab and what this does is it shows us all the age.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.510
Tim Allen assets for the page.

01:03.510 --> 01:07.950
And by the way if you want to make this bigger or smaller you can hit control plus to make it bigger

01:07.980 --> 01:10.480
or control minus to make it smaller.

01:10.500 --> 01:17.130
Also if you want it to dock on the side you could hit a guy like that or the other side or you could

01:17.130 --> 01:18.450
even undock it.

01:18.480 --> 01:23.870
This will undock it and put it in a separate window I just I usually like to have it on the bottom.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.730
But anyways this is the H team all over here.

01:26.730 --> 01:28.300
This is the CSX.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.990
Now notice when I hover over something like the body it actually highlights everything that's in the

01:33.990 --> 01:38.830
body if I hover over the div with the idea of welcome it hovers over that.

01:39.180 --> 01:45.840
If I on collapses and I go over the H to paragraph so whatever I hover over it's going to highlight

01:45.930 --> 01:51.840
in the browser and then if we want to select something we can go ahead and hit the select tool.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.890
So it turned blue and then let's say I want to look at the H.

01:54.890 --> 02:02.130
Tim Allen CSX for this welcome this H too right here I can click that and notice that it's now highlighted

02:02.130 --> 02:04.800
down here and it also shows me the CSX.

02:05.220 --> 02:12.630
So it shows me the H to CSX and the class of primary heading because that's a class that's actually

02:12.630 --> 02:14.010
on this element.

02:14.040 --> 02:20.820
Now we didn't put any of this H to stuff in here the font size display block there's some margin here.

02:20.820 --> 02:24.810
Font weight bold this is default browser styling.

02:24.900 --> 02:29.520
Every browser has default styling for the most part it's that it's pretty much the same.

02:29.730 --> 02:35.790
And the way that we can tell this is but from the browser is right here user agent style sheet K by

02:35.790 --> 02:42.240
user age and it basically means the browser that you're using this here this styling is coming from

02:42.300 --> 02:44.220
our selectors each team I'll file.

02:44.220 --> 02:51.000
Now usually this will be a CSX file because like I said usually we use external CSX files and you'll

02:51.000 --> 02:55.640
see that when we start getting into projects but it's just going to give us whatever the file name the

02:55.660 --> 02:57.980
CSX is located in.

02:58.000 --> 02:58.380
All right.

02:58.380 --> 03:02.180
Now we can actually change stuff here too temporarily.

03:02.190 --> 03:09.960
So this welcome tech right here if I wanted to change this to say hello and then click somewhere else

03:09.960 --> 03:12.130
to see the text actually changes.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.870
I can also like I can change this if I want to.

03:16.020 --> 03:24.180
I don't know other class and now you'll see that it's no longer blue because it doesn't have the primary

03:24.180 --> 03:25.320
heading class.

03:25.380 --> 03:27.880
The primary heading is where that blue came from.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.440
OK.

03:29.760 --> 03:38.430
Now what's cool is you can do this with any site like if we go to Google dot com and we open up our

03:39.390 --> 03:41.190
tools here.

03:41.190 --> 03:47.700
And what I want to do is click the Select Select eye icon and then this button right here.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.650
So this is actually an input.

03:49.650 --> 03:55.530
It has the type of submit member we we learned about this stuff in the in the last section and the value

03:55.530 --> 03:56.830
is I'm feeling lucky.

03:56.850 --> 04:02.640
So if I double click this I can change this to whatever and say I'm feeling awesome and you might want

04:02.640 --> 04:07.190
to have some fun with this and noticed that it's changed now in the browser.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.140
Now it hasn't changed on Google's servers so other people can see it.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.770
It's only locally to our browser.

04:13.980 --> 04:17.040
And if we reload the page it goes back to normal.

04:17.100 --> 04:24.720
So if we wanted to change some CSX let's go up here and let's click on the body that gives us the CSX

04:24.720 --> 04:25.370
of the body.

04:25.380 --> 04:28.850
Let's say we wanted to change the background here which is white.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.900
This is hexadecimal for white.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.590
Let's change it to red.

04:32.610 --> 04:36.480
So now we have a red body can change the color here to White.

04:38.010 --> 04:42.180
And notice the text up here is not white because this has its own styling.

04:42.180 --> 04:47.800
So if I click the select tool and let's click one of these links right here.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.620
Notice the color is black.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.370
So I'm going to select that and change it to white.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.870
And now these links are white.

04:54.430 --> 04:54.740
OK.

04:54.750 --> 04:58.330
So you can really have some fun here you could replace the image link if you want.

04:58.340 --> 05:02.360
What's and mean to do that but yes he now goes back to normal.

05:02.430 --> 05:04.010
But you could change a whole bunch of stuff.

05:04.020 --> 05:07.350
You can add content and it's only local to your machine.

05:07.350 --> 05:13.090
No one else sees it obviously that the Internet would be a crazy place if you could just edit any one

05:13.090 --> 05:18.770
site but it is kind of fun to mess with and you can learn a lot from doing stuff like that.

05:18.780 --> 05:19.110
All right.

05:19.140 --> 05:25.380
So I just wanted to kind of introduce you to the the chrome tools the developer tools and we will be

05:25.380 --> 05:28.720
using these more as we go along in the course.

05:28.740 --> 05:31.730
So in the next video we're going to start to look at fonts.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.750
I want to look at different font families.

05:33.750 --> 05:38.040
I want to talk about Web save fonts and we'll also look at colors.

05:38.130 --> 05:38.370
All right.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.660
So I'll see you in the next video.
