WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:05.980
All right guys so we're gonna start on our projects we're gonna create our files and add the H team

00:05.980 --> 00:10.440
L for at least the nav bar and hopefully style it in this video.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.360
We're also going to add the fab Akon to the tab.

00:13.470 --> 00:19.620
So in your in the previous lecture you should have a zip file called Image Resources and what you're

00:19.620 --> 00:25.290
going to want to do is create a folder I called my news grid I created and I am G folder and I put all

00:25.290 --> 00:27.220
of the images in here.

00:27.300 --> 00:34.680
OK so as far as images we have the logo dot PMG which is the main logo we have a logo light PMG for

00:34.680 --> 00:35.520
the footer.

00:35.580 --> 00:40.770
I also include the PSAT which is the photoshop file in case you guys wanted that.

00:40.770 --> 00:46.560
And then there's an icon dot PMG which is just the icon and we're gonna use this to create a fab Akon

00:46.980 --> 00:51.840
and then we have the showcase or a featured dot j peg which is the featured article in the showcase

00:51.840 --> 00:56.000
area and then a folder called articles with all the other images.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.450
So once you get those.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.530
Let's go ahead and let's create our files.

01:01.530 --> 01:04.540
So we're gonna create index start each team l.

01:05.010 --> 01:12.150
We're gonna have an about Dot HMO and we're gonna have an article dot H team L which will represent

01:12.150 --> 01:20.880
a single article and then let's create a folder called CSX inside CSX we'll have a style dot CSX and

01:20.880 --> 01:24.810
we'll have a mobile dot CSX.

01:24.830 --> 01:25.490
Okay.

01:25.680 --> 01:35.220
And we can close all of this except for index each team L and let's open up style CSX OK so let's add

01:35.220 --> 01:43.260
in our boilerplate here and for the title I'm just going to say news grid and let's say latest news

01:45.530 --> 01:53.910
OK and let's link our style sheets so we'll say link and let's do CSX slash style CSX and then under

01:53.910 --> 01:56.090
that we want our mobile CSX.

01:56.100 --> 02:00.330
Copy that down its changes to mobile CSX.

02:00.330 --> 02:07.020
However we only want this to show if the screen is 768 or less so we're going to add a media attribute

02:07.020 --> 02:08.820
and say screen.

02:09.390 --> 02:16.070
And Max with 768 pixels.

02:16.190 --> 02:16.580
OK.

02:16.590 --> 02:25.380
Now we're also using font awesome so let's head over to font awesome dot com and let's say start using

02:25.380 --> 02:31.190
free and then we're going to grab this link and put it right above the style dot CSX.

02:31.200 --> 02:31.560
All right.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.720
So let's take care of the fab Akon.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.220
Now what I usually do is I use a service called dynamic drive.

02:37.230 --> 02:40.370
I've used this literally for about eight or nine years.

02:40.470 --> 02:46.680
So if you search for a dynamic drive fab Akon you'll get this link here it's actually tools dot dynamic

02:46.680 --> 02:53.310
dot drive dot com slash fab Akon and what happens here is you can upload an image.

02:53.310 --> 03:01.110
So we're gonna grab the icon dot PMG and then click Create icon and it will generate a fava Kahn dot

03:01.230 --> 03:03.530
ISIL file or Iko file.

03:03.570 --> 03:09.320
So we want to download that and let's go ahead and grab that.

03:09.370 --> 03:15.630
I already have one here but I'm going to grab that and copy it and then let's bring it over to our root

03:15.630 --> 03:16.140
folder.

03:16.140 --> 03:16.440
Ok.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.980
Don't put it in the image folder.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.700
Put it in the root so we'll paste that in.

03:20.730 --> 03:21.320
Good.

03:21.510 --> 03:27.480
And then all we have to do is add this little snippet here this link to the fav icon and we'll place

03:27.480 --> 03:28.640
that right here.

03:28.770 --> 03:33.270
And I'm just going to remove the slash because it will give us some issues if we just open it with the

03:33.270 --> 03:35.400
file system it won't display.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.250
So let's remove that and that's it.

03:38.250 --> 03:47.120
Let's save let's open with live server and if you don't see the fab icon here you need to just clear

03:47.120 --> 03:52.490
your cash or at least I do because I've already done this so I'm going to on I'm on a Max I'm going

03:52.490 --> 03:58.880
to do command shift R and it will reload if you're on Windows I believe it's shift F five and now you

03:58.880 --> 04:01.600
can see the fab icon displays in the tab.

04:01.600 --> 04:01.870
OK.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.830
So it's as easy as that.

04:03.830 --> 04:06.890
So now let's start to add some markup.

04:06.890 --> 04:14.720
First thing is the nav bar so we're going to have a nav with the I.D. of main NAV and let's put a container

04:14.720 --> 04:21.110
in here to contain everything to the max with that we're gonna set and then we're going to have our

04:21.110 --> 04:21.860
logo.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.200
So image with the class of logo.

04:24.200 --> 04:33.180
It's gonna go to image slash logo dot P. Angie and for the also just say news grid.

04:33.710 --> 04:38.250
And then under that we want our social media icons.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.210
And this is gonna be a grid.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.330
I'm going to set this to grid.

04:41.330 --> 04:45.550
Normally I'd probably use flex for this but I want it right.

04:45.610 --> 04:48.190
I really want to focus on the grid system here.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.620
So each one of these will be grid items.

04:51.620 --> 04:51.880
All right.

04:51.910 --> 05:04.550
So let's create and actually let's give this div a class of social and then we're gonna have a link

05:04.640 --> 05:05.700
with.

05:06.460 --> 05:10.570
I'll do a link and we'll just set this to go to Facebook.

05:10.610 --> 05:15.480
Obviously this would be their Facebook page but this is a fictional Web site.

05:15.860 --> 05:22.280
And then inside here we want to put the whole put an eye tag with the class of F A and it's actually

05:22.280 --> 05:28.910
going to be f a b the social media icons have a class of F A B instead of F.A. s and then this will

05:28.910 --> 05:30.920
be F A Dash Facebook

05:33.690 --> 05:34.290
like that.

05:35.260 --> 05:35.780
OK.

05:35.800 --> 05:42.510
And we're going to also add a class of f a dash to X which will make it larger.

05:42.670 --> 05:49.450
And then since this is an external Web site let's add target equals underscore blank which will open

05:49.490 --> 05:50.920
in a new tab.

05:50.950 --> 05:51.250
All right.

05:51.250 --> 05:57.310
So let's take this and let's copy this down three more times and we're gonna do Twitter.

05:58.710 --> 06:06.910
Let's change this to Twitter the icon and then this I'm gonna do a can command control D so I can choose

06:06.910 --> 06:15.130
the next iteration of Facebook and I'm gonna change this to Instagram and then I'll select this one

06:16.420 --> 06:19.530
control D and then let's do YouTube

06:22.320 --> 06:22.800
all right.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.740
So if I save this we should see this.

06:25.770 --> 06:26.260
OK.

06:26.270 --> 06:29.170
And don't worry we'll make this look better.

06:29.200 --> 06:35.420
The last thing we need in this container is going to be our links so or our list with the links.

06:35.440 --> 06:40.390
So let's do a U L L I say a.

06:40.480 --> 06:45.820
I'm actually going to give this a class of current because I want the current page to be highlighted.

06:45.820 --> 06:49.030
So it's a class current.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.590
It's gonna go to index start each team L and let's say home.

06:53.750 --> 07:03.330
OK we'll copy this down and let's say about changes to about Dot H team L and let's clear this class.

07:03.550 --> 07:03.900
All right.

07:03.910 --> 07:09.400
So it's going to look absolutely horrible for now in the next video we're gonna start to add some of

07:09.400 --> 07:11.830
our core styles and then we'll style the.

07:11.860 --> 07:12.520
Now bar.
