WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:04.000
All right so in the last video we talked about Raymond M units.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.870
Now we're going to talk about VH and VW which is viewport height and viewport widths so the viewport

00:10.870 --> 00:13.600
is this whole area inside the browser.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.990
Basically the browser body.

00:16.050 --> 00:16.570
OK.

00:16.570 --> 00:26.890
And when we say for instance 50 VH which is 50 viewport height it's going to take up 50 of 100 viewport

00:26.920 --> 00:27.670
heights.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.760
And the way we think of this is slices.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.660
So each viewport height is a slice across.

00:34.700 --> 00:40.150
OK it goes up and down and slices across and there's always going to be one hundred of them.

00:40.150 --> 00:40.450
OK.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.910
No matter how big or small the browser is.

00:43.010 --> 00:47.380
You make it tiny you could stretch it across your whole screen there's always one hundred of viewport

00:47.380 --> 00:50.230
heights and each one is a slice.

00:50.230 --> 00:55.480
Now for viewport widths it's the same thing only it goes across and the slices go down.

00:55.480 --> 01:03.400
So there's 100 slices that go this way and you can set your content to take up two or one hundred or

01:03.400 --> 01:07.930
anything between zero and one hundred viewport heights and viewport widths.

01:07.990 --> 01:14.760
So we're going to create a tiny little project kind of a landing page using.

01:14.800 --> 01:20.560
So I can give you an example of how to use these in viewport heights or use much more than viewport

01:20.560 --> 01:24.920
widths because for the most part things go all the way across any way.

01:25.000 --> 01:35.560
So we're going to create a new file here let's call it 1 5 underscore VH underscore VW dot HD CML and

01:35.560 --> 01:47.360
we're going to put our head and body tags it's a V H and V W units and we'll put in our style.

01:48.290 --> 01:57.220
Okay so let's let's add our each team out first and we're gonna put in a header tag and inside the header

01:57.250 --> 02:07.190
let's do an H one we'll just say welcome to our website and we'll put a paragraph.

02:07.210 --> 02:14.970
Let's do Lorem we'll do Lord 15 and see underneath that.

02:14.980 --> 02:19.810
Let's put a link with a class of B T N S we want to link.

02:19.810 --> 02:21.330
So it's gonna be an A tag.

02:21.370 --> 02:30.880
The class of B10 and so I'm going to go anywhere and inside the link we'll just say find out more.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.230
All right.

02:31.240 --> 02:37.340
Now in the style first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of resets so we're going

02:37.340 --> 02:46.390
to use an asterisk meaning target everything and let's set the box sizing to board our box and then

02:46.420 --> 02:49.390
let's remove the margin and padding from everything

02:53.720 --> 02:54.960
OK.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.320
And I'm just going to open this with the live server.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.740
So this is what it should look like.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.700
Notice the margin padding is removed from everything.

03:03.700 --> 03:11.710
Let's add in the body style because I want this to look decent so we'll say font family and let's grab

03:11.710 --> 03:18.190
this right here is a go UI to Homa and for the header

03:21.520 --> 03:23.460
I'm gonna do it.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.670
Let's do a background.

03:26.860 --> 03:27.910
I'm going to add an image.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.590
But for now I'm just going to add a color.

03:29.590 --> 03:35.190
So just a dark color and let's make that the color of the text white.

03:35.660 --> 03:38.220
And let's save that and see what we get.

03:38.230 --> 03:44.920
So by default it's just going to the the background color is going to wrap.

03:45.730 --> 03:47.630
You know it's going to wrap the content.

03:47.800 --> 03:53.000
If we add more paragraphs and stuff it's going to just go down along with the content.

03:53.050 --> 04:00.130
What I want is the header background to take up the entire thing the entire screen and you might think

04:00.550 --> 04:07.620
well let's set the height to 100 percent of its container which is the body.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.610
So let's save that.

04:09.660 --> 04:12.210
OK I saved it and there's no difference.

04:12.380 --> 04:15.540
And this is kind of kind of a gotcha.

04:15.850 --> 04:18.960
I'm just going to show you that if we look at the body.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.630
Right.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.940
Let's let's click on the body here.

04:23.020 --> 04:29.380
So the body is being highlighted you may think the body takes up the entire browser body but it's not

04:29.390 --> 04:33.080
it's just wrapping whatever that whatever is in the content.

04:33.250 --> 04:33.620
Right.

04:33.940 --> 04:40.750
So setting into 100 percent of the body is literally just doing what what it's already doing.

04:40.750 --> 04:44.680
It's just coming down to here we want it to cover everything.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.050
This is where viewport heights come in.

04:47.050 --> 04:53.230
So I'm going to go ahead and change this from 100 percent to 100 VH and save.

04:53.230 --> 04:54.980
And now you can see it can.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.030
It covers everything.

04:57.350 --> 05:02.890
OK regardless of how big or small the browser is you know it can make it bigger or smaller.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.920
It doesn't matter it's taking up 100 viewport heights.

05:05.920 --> 05:13.690
Now if I change this to 50 viewport heights and save it takes up exactly half because remember there's

05:13.690 --> 05:15.160
100 slices right.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.630
This is taking up 50 of those 100 slices.

05:18.790 --> 05:23.890
If I change this to 20 it's going to take up 20 of those 100 slices.

05:23.950 --> 05:27.700
So this makes creating landing pages very easily.

05:27.700 --> 05:33.660
You know it's very popular now to have a like a whole big image with some text and a button.

05:33.850 --> 05:39.540
That's a very popular look and VH allows us to do that very easily.

05:39.670 --> 05:42.150
So let's make this an actual image.

05:42.250 --> 05:53.170
I'm gonna grab a remote image from source dot on Splash dot com and if you go down here let's see.

05:53.200 --> 05:59.350
So random from a collection.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.460
Let's grab let's grab the daily photo.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.880
So this right here.

06:04.010 --> 06:09.080
This will give us a random daily photo I'm going to grab that and I'm going to add this to the background

06:09.120 --> 06:14.470
I don't know if I've showed you this before but you can have a background color and then put a U.R.L.

06:14.510 --> 06:15.470
after it.

06:15.470 --> 06:19.560
So basically of the color and then you have the image on top of it.

06:19.700 --> 06:25.070
So let's put in here that link.

06:25.070 --> 06:26.870
Let's save it and go back.

06:27.050 --> 06:31.400
And now you'll see we have a background image yours will probably be different.

06:31.600 --> 06:38.760
Close that up yours will probably be different because it's a daily photo and they change it daily.

06:38.760 --> 06:43.520
Now notice that it's repeating and I don't think I've had the chance to even show you this.

06:43.580 --> 06:49.470
Let's see the repeat since our window is bigger than the actual image.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.830
Then it repeats.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.920
So we're going to add some other properties to this background.

06:54.050 --> 06:57.480
So one is gonna be no repeat.

06:57.710 --> 06:58.570
Save that.

06:58.580 --> 07:03.550
And now you can see it doesn't repeat OK.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.830
Another thing I want to do is I want it to cover.

07:05.830 --> 07:10.490
I want to center it and I want it to cover the whole page the whole background.

07:10.540 --> 07:13.270
So in addition to no repeat.

07:13.270 --> 07:20.830
Let's do center center on the x and y access and then slash cover and save.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.630
And now it covers the entire thing.

07:22.630 --> 07:26.810
If I stretch this so it's it's still it's always going to cover.

07:26.890 --> 07:35.260
So that's gonna be your most popular your most popular way to do this or the most common way to do this.

07:35.350 --> 07:37.780
Now let's work on actually centering the text.

07:37.780 --> 07:43.810
Now this is where flex blocks actually works really well but we haven't gotten to that yet so we're

07:43.810 --> 07:47.020
just going to use patterns and stuff like that.

07:47.050 --> 07:54.250
So for the header first of all I want to text align everything and I could stop here I mean I showed

07:54.250 --> 08:02.080
you guys what the h and why I didn't show you VW yet but yeah actually let's do that first so let's

08:02.080 --> 08:09.250
add in a width of let's say 50 V W and save.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.050
And now you'll see it's only going to take up half.

08:12.130 --> 08:12.430
Okay.

08:12.460 --> 08:19.600
So it's the exact same thing only it goes horizontal instead of vertical but I personally don't use

08:19.600 --> 08:25.510
VW that much because as you can see it goes all the way across any anyway the height is a different

08:25.510 --> 08:26.700
story it doesn't.

08:26.890 --> 08:32.230
It's not going to go all the way down on its own but yeah that's VW.

08:32.230 --> 08:37.820
So let's go ahead and text aligned to the center.

08:37.930 --> 08:38.920
So we'll save that.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.470
Now everything is aligned to the center.

08:41.470 --> 08:51.040
Make this a little bigger and let's see now what I want to do is add some padding within the header.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.370
Let's do two Ram.

08:54.370 --> 08:56.680
So now there's two Ram padding all around.

08:56.680 --> 09:01.060
But I want to push this down more and there's better ways to do this with Flex blocks.

09:01.060 --> 09:05.500
We could we could align it directly in the middle but we haven't gotten to that yet.

09:05.560 --> 09:11.300
So I'm just going to add padding top let's do padding top.

09:11.350 --> 09:11.860
Let's try.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.200
Two hundred.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.960
Now will we use Ram units.

09:15.970 --> 09:20.730
Let's do five ram.

09:20.830 --> 09:21.040
No.

09:21.070 --> 09:21.910
We want more than that.

09:21.910 --> 09:30.920
Let's do 10 that's still still not low enough let's do 15.

09:31.340 --> 09:31.720
All right.

09:31.810 --> 09:34.000
And if I were to make this smaller.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.490
Good so let's let's make this look somewhat decent.

09:39.490 --> 09:45.030
We're going to target some of these other elements like the H one the paragraph the button and style.

09:45.030 --> 09:45.880
Those a little bit.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.540
So it's a header.

09:50.410 --> 09:58.390
Actually we want header H1 and we're going to change the font size to three ram.

09:58.690 --> 10:02.040
So that's going to be six sixteen is the default route.

10:02.080 --> 10:09.880
Font size it's gonna be sixteen times three and four the paragraph say header paragraph.

10:10.060 --> 10:13.070
Let's do margin and let's do one Ram.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.750
Top and bottom zero left and right.

10:15.820 --> 10:19.290
That way it pushes the link down and pushes the header up.

10:19.540 --> 10:24.640
And then for the button or that I should say the link with the class of B10 n where we'll just make

10:24.640 --> 10:25.660
that look decent.

10:26.620 --> 10:31.900
And I know that this doesn't have anything to do with VH and VW but I want to reiterate things we've

10:31.900 --> 10:33.250
already gone over.

10:33.400 --> 10:41.560
So we want this button to be inline block because by default links are inline and then we're gonna add

10:41.800 --> 10:45.830
text decoration none.

10:45.970 --> 10:50.180
Let's do a background of light grey.

10:50.500 --> 11:00.970
Change the color to dark grey and do the padding we'll use Ram we'll do zero point seventy five on the

11:00.970 --> 11:01.950
top and bottom.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.210
And to ram on the left and right.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
And save.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.400
And there's our button.

11:07.510 --> 11:07.770
OK.

11:07.780 --> 11:08.850
So it looks a little better.

11:08.860 --> 11:15.430
And e I mean the text might blend and not blend well with the background image but later on I'm going

11:15.430 --> 11:22.510
to show you how we can use CSX overlays we can have like a dark overlay over the image so that the text

11:22.510 --> 11:30.870
is more readable so like I said this the viewport heights it's it's always gonna be a hundred even if

11:30.870 --> 11:32.370
we have content below it.

11:32.370 --> 11:38.760
So let's go below the header and let's add a section and we'll put an H three we'll just say like about

11:39.630 --> 11:46.200
our company and then we'll put a paragraph let's do Lorem 50

11:49.980 --> 11:57.270
and then I'm just going to add for that section I'm just gonna add padding of to ram just so it's not

11:57.270 --> 12:01.570
right up against the edge OK.

12:01.800 --> 12:07.800
So notice that it's still it's still gonna take up 100 viewport height and then immediately when I scroll

12:07.800 --> 12:15.610
down we're gonna see that content and it doesn't matter how how tall or short the browser is.

12:15.610 --> 12:19.650
So right now you might think that as we scroll we'll see more of the image.

12:19.660 --> 12:20.400
But no.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.710
As we scroll it's going to go right to that content.

12:23.710 --> 12:31.210
So viewport Heights is great for landing pages like this where you have this large image because it

12:31.210 --> 12:32.710
doesn't matter where.

12:32.710 --> 12:36.200
How how tall or short your browser is.

12:36.220 --> 12:39.190
As soon as you scroll down you're going to see the content.

12:39.190 --> 12:45.300
It only takes up one 100 viewport heights of whatever the current browser size is.

12:45.310 --> 12:45.620
All right.

12:45.620 --> 12:51.790
Now let's see if we make this smaller like that still looks good.

12:51.790 --> 12:55.840
So this is actually pretty responsive.

12:56.950 --> 12:57.580
Let's see.

12:57.610 --> 13:02.430
Let's actually check it out with with the chrome tools device toolbar.

13:02.440 --> 13:06.300
So we're going to hit that case.

13:06.300 --> 13:11.490
So that looks pretty good we'll look on it on an iPad.

13:11.510 --> 13:12.260
Good.

13:12.260 --> 13:15.370
Now let's try an iPhone landscape.

13:15.410 --> 13:19.400
So we need to make this a little bigger and we'll click the landscape.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.150
So in this case I would probably want this too.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.650
Yeah that doesn't look very good.

13:24.650 --> 13:26.960
So I'd want this to be moved up.

13:26.960 --> 13:32.570
So let's let's practice our media query and we don't have to do much we always we just need to change

13:32.570 --> 13:33.870
the padding of the header.

13:34.250 --> 13:41.630
So let's say media and I would say max height.

13:41.810 --> 13:46.200
So max height let's do 450 pixels.

13:46.250 --> 13:55.130
What this means is that when the the viewport is four hundred and fifty pixels or less then this styling

13:55.130 --> 13:55.880
will kick in.

13:55.880 --> 14:06.770
So we'll see a header and see we initially set the padding top to what I think it was 15 Ram.

14:06.770 --> 14:11.600
So let's let's try five REM and save.

14:11.600 --> 14:18.760
And then we go so now it looks good on landscape and if we go back you can see it goes back to 15 REM.

14:18.980 --> 14:25.680
So it's a good example of where and when to use a media query.

14:25.700 --> 14:26.030
All right.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.150
So I think that's going to be it guys.

14:28.160 --> 14:34.840
What I want to do in the next video is take our hotel Web site project and I want to make that responsive

14:34.850 --> 14:42.020
so we're actually going to be adding media queries to that project and just making it overall making

14:42.020 --> 14:42.740
it better.

14:42.740 --> 14:43.000
All right.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.240
So I'll see you in the next video.
