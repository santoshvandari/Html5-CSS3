00:00.150 --> 00:00.330
All right.

00:00.330 --> 00:06.700
In this video we're going to look at the display property with the values inline block and inline block.

00:06.710 --> 00:11.120
Now display is very important because that's actually how we implement flex blocks.

00:11.130 --> 00:13.680
That's how we implement the CSX grid.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.700
But we're not going to get to that just yet and we'll do that a little later.

00:17.730 --> 00:22.440
So in this video I want to show you how to turn block level elements into inline and vice versa.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.240
And also look at inline block.

00:24.250 --> 00:34.250
So let's create a new file called let's call it 10 underscore inline underscore block dot h t AML

00:37.100 --> 00:48.610
and I'm just going to close this up and for the title will say inline and block styling.

00:49.570 --> 00:50.040
Okay.

00:50.070 --> 00:57.630
So in the body I'm going to start off with a well I guess I only only even need to give it we're only

00:57.710 --> 01:01.400
we're going to only going to have one you l so we'll just use that as a selector.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.410
But this is gonna be like a menu.

01:03.420 --> 01:07.020
So we'll do in a tag in here

01:09.930 --> 01:17.030
so go just nowhere and let's say that these are like categories maybe it's I don't know a list of blog

01:17.030 --> 01:28.820
posts or something like that so we'll just say like technology and for this one let's say business and

01:28.820 --> 01:31.120
I don't know fashion.

01:31.160 --> 01:31.420
All right.

01:31.430 --> 01:32.930
So let's go ahead and open this up.

01:34.910 --> 01:38.180
And by default list items are block level.

01:38.180 --> 01:38.500
Right.

01:38.500 --> 01:44.540
If we open up our our tools and we we use our element selector we look at the list item you can see

01:44.540 --> 01:47.680
that it goes all the way across and it knocks the next one down.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.030
So that that's a block level element.

01:50.030 --> 01:57.290
Now we can change that to be inline and in fact this could be a way to create a horizontal menu horizontal

01:57.290 --> 01:58.700
navigation.

01:58.700 --> 02:06.590
So let's go up into our styling and let's grab on to the UL and let's set it to.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.510
I'm sorry not the well the ally

02:11.410 --> 02:17.620
and let's set it to display in line and save.

02:17.620 --> 02:20.370
So notice that now it's going this way.

02:20.410 --> 02:24.620
And the bullets are no longer showing either.

02:24.640 --> 02:30.070
Now you probably want to spread these out a little bit so we could do like Actually I'd probably put

02:30.070 --> 02:40.970
these on the on the links so ally a and let's set padding right to 10 pixels.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.730
So it's going to spread them apart.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.890
Actually it's 220.

02:45.940 --> 02:46.190
All right.

02:46.190 --> 02:50.540
So that's how we can change block level elements to inline.

02:50.650 --> 02:56.310
Now let's take an inline elements such as an image and make it block level and I'm gonna give you a.

02:56.340 --> 02:59.140
I'm going to show you a reason why you would do this.

02:59.140 --> 03:08.050
So let's put a couple of line breaks in and we'll put in an image and inside of our folder we still

03:08.050 --> 03:11.120
have the AMG folder with the leaf dot PMG.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.290
I'm going to use that.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.810
So and here let's do dot slash.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.300
So the current directory.

03:17.290 --> 03:21.850
It go into the image directory and We want Leaf PMG for the all.

03:21.850 --> 03:25.540
I'll just say my image and save that.

03:26.020 --> 03:26.620
OK.

03:26.650 --> 03:30.130
Now this is an inline image or I'm sorry an inline element.

03:30.160 --> 03:36.830
If we grab the selector and we take a look you see how it doesn't go all the way across.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.460
If I were to put another image in.

03:38.460 --> 03:43.710
Actually if I just duplicate this and save it's going to go next to it it doesn't get pushed on to the

03:43.710 --> 03:45.540
next line.

03:45.540 --> 03:49.680
Now I want to make this a block level element when we get rid of one of these.

03:50.010 --> 03:54.940
And the reason I want to do that is because I want to add margin Otto because I want it in the middle.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.430
If I were to do that now

04:02.520 --> 04:06.270
if I were to do that now nothing happens because we can't do this.

04:06.330 --> 04:10.030
We can't do margin auto on an inline element.

04:10.190 --> 04:10.670
Okay.

04:10.680 --> 04:17.040
It needs it needs to be block level so we'll simply say display block and save.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.740
And now we can actually add margin auto.

04:20.490 --> 04:27.300
I can't tell you how how confusing that was to me a long time ago when I was just trying to simply center

04:27.300 --> 04:30.210
an image and margin auto just wouldn't work.

04:30.210 --> 04:36.290
I didn't realize that the the element had to be be display block to be able to do that.

04:36.330 --> 04:36.630
All right.

04:36.650 --> 04:37.350
So that's it.

04:37.380 --> 04:43.850
These are two situations where you would want to display something that's normally in line.

04:43.910 --> 04:44.270
I'm sorry.

04:44.280 --> 04:48.630
Normally block is in line and normally in line is block.

04:48.630 --> 04:54.390
Now let's say we want some divs here some some box divs like we've been dealing with just going to put

04:54.390 --> 05:03.780
a couple of line breaks and let's do a class of box and an H three just say heading and then let's put

05:03.780 --> 05:05.970
paragraph Lorem 20

05:08.880 --> 05:10.770
and let's say we have three of these

05:13.840 --> 05:14.420
OK.

05:14.460 --> 05:22.950
Go ahead and save that and let's say we want to align these going across.

05:22.950 --> 05:23.550
Actually know what.

05:23.550 --> 05:27.930
First let's style them a little bit just so we can kind of see the outline and stuff like that.

05:27.930 --> 05:30.560
So we'll do what we've been doing.

05:30.560 --> 05:35.310
Just give him a quick background.

05:35.340 --> 05:46.810
Border actually let's not even Sullivan do a border let's just do padding 20 pixels.

05:47.270 --> 05:52.710
What else do margin bottom 15 pixel.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.970
And we want these to display horizontally.

05:55.970 --> 05:59.470
So obviously we need a width right.

05:59.510 --> 06:08.120
So with let's do thirty two percent now if I save that we get that with.

06:08.270 --> 06:13.250
But they're still on top of each other because by default divs are displayed as block.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.260
So maybe we just need to do inline.

06:15.260 --> 06:15.500
Right.

06:15.530 --> 06:19.130
Let's do display in line and save.

06:19.130 --> 06:22.850
And that doesn't work and be the reason this isn't working.

06:23.030 --> 06:29.900
And it'll show you right in here and V.S. code that this property width is being ignored because display

06:30.320 --> 06:32.470
you can't use with on inline.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.100
OK.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.550
And the margin is also being ignored.

06:37.580 --> 06:43.670
So the solution to this if we want these to go across is to use inline block which is basically like

06:43.670 --> 06:45.180
a mix of both.

06:45.260 --> 06:49.960
It goes horizontal but it also allows us to add widths.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.190
So let's change it to inline Dash.

06:52.190 --> 06:55.190
BLOCK And save.

06:55.190 --> 07:00.670
Now this is getting knocked on to the next line because again we have padding.

07:01.010 --> 07:05.720
So that's getting added to the width because we didn't add the box sizing properties so let's go up

07:05.720 --> 07:06.140
here

07:09.250 --> 07:11.170
and let's say box.

07:11.170 --> 07:11.730
Actually no.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.550
Let's just put it that's you.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.370
That's what I.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.590
I'll usually do.

07:17.590 --> 07:20.440
But we can just put it in here.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.440
So box sizing order box and save.

07:25.450 --> 07:28.220
And now you'll see that there are lying side by side.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.580
You can probably even do 33.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.680
No let's do like thirty two point.

07:33.850 --> 07:37.480
I don't think I mentioned that we can do decimals and percentages like that.

07:38.510 --> 07:38.790
OK.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.750
So that looks pretty cool actually.

07:42.110 --> 07:49.600
But yeah that's so we have display inline display block and display inline block and then later on we

07:49.600 --> 07:52.720
get to flex we can do display flex.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.810
We can also do display grid.

07:54.970 --> 07:59.230
And I'm going to I'm going to talk all about that and the different properties that are associated with

07:59.230 --> 08:01.330
that as well but yeah.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.040
So that's that's that in the next video we're going to look at positioning there's different types of

08:06.040 --> 08:09.010
positioning relative absolute fixed.

08:09.010 --> 08:14.070
So I want to explain what the differences between all of those in the next video.
