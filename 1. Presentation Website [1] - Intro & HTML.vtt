WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:04.980
All right guys so we're gonna start a small project here and has a presentation Web site.

00:04.980 --> 00:11.280
So this is not really like a mainstream Web site but something that maybe you would do at some kind

00:11.280 --> 00:15.270
of con friends if you want to if you want to have some kind of presentation but you don't want to use

00:15.270 --> 00:16.050
PowerPoint.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.130
You want to build something custom.

00:18.240 --> 00:23.300
Obviously this is very simplified but you could add graphics to it charge stuff like that.

00:23.340 --> 00:28.290
So basically we're going to be using a bunch of stuff that we've we've already learned.

00:28.290 --> 00:33.750
So we're going to use variables we're gonna use a little bit of a key frame animation transition stuff

00:33.750 --> 00:34.360
like that.

00:34.620 --> 00:41.460
So basically when the page loads when it's going to reload it the talk comes in the side comes in.

00:41.490 --> 00:41.820
All right.

00:41.820 --> 00:44.280
And then we also have a transition on the button.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.200
You can see it kind of fades nicely.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.950
And this is like though the landing page.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.860
So the greeting page and then notice there's no scroll bars.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.460
I can't scroll up and down.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.610
We actually have to click the button to go to the next page.

00:57.690 --> 01:04.770
And what I've done is I've integrated that smooth scrolling J query script RJ query code that we used

01:04.770 --> 01:08.250
a while back but you don't have to do that if you don't use it.

01:08.250 --> 01:13.250
You'll just click and It'll just it'll just go to the next page it won't have the scrolling effect.

01:13.260 --> 01:15.420
So it's up to you if you want to use that or not.

01:15.420 --> 01:17.820
And then notice this is just page 2.

01:17.870 --> 01:23.190
You would change the title here and the content you could add any content you want we have previous

01:23.190 --> 01:28.980
which will bring us back up and then we have next which will bring us to the next page which is a different

01:28.980 --> 01:30.270
color background.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.570
We're gonna use variables for that and then the next page.

01:33.690 --> 01:36.050
And of course if you wanted to add more you could.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.930
But I just I just have four pages now.

01:38.940 --> 01:42.930
These are not separate each team all pages it's all an end in this.

01:42.930 --> 01:48.420
Well I called it landing each team Al but we'll be calling it indexed on each team L but it appears

01:48.420 --> 01:50.620
to be multiple pages.

01:50.640 --> 01:50.990
OK.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.320
So this is what we'll be building.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.770
So let's get started.

01:53.820 --> 01:57.600
So I'm going to go ahead and close that up open a new tab.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.420
Let's go to about here.

02:00.420 --> 02:06.030
Just because I want to have both on the same screen and I just have an empty folder called presentation

02:06.030 --> 02:14.490
Web site and we're going to create an indexed dot each time I'll file and let's create.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.440
I'm just gonna do a style dot CSI.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.810
So I'm not even going to create a CSX folder because this is a very small project.

02:22.950 --> 02:31.110
So in our index each is generate our boilerplate I'm just gonna close this and let's just say presentation

02:32.970 --> 02:38.480
for our title and we'll put in actually you know what we're gonna do is link our style sheet.

02:38.490 --> 02:45.060
So let's go above the title and link and let's link to style dot CSX.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.270
We don't have a CSX folder so we don't have to do CSX slash style.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.750
And then for the content the content is going to be pretty simple.

02:54.750 --> 03:00.630
So we're gonna have a section actually that's put a comment here we'll say this is gonna be page one

03:01.170 --> 03:04.800
which is the intro and it's going to be a section.

03:04.800 --> 03:12.570
These are all gonna be sections with I.D. So we're gonna give it an I.D. of page dash one and then each

03:12.570 --> 03:14.660
one is gonna have a class.

03:14.660 --> 03:20.020
I don't want to put the word class when to say dot and then the class name which is page.

03:20.500 --> 03:20.960
Okay.

03:20.970 --> 03:31.950
And then we'll have an H one and let's say Welcome to my presentation and then under that let's put

03:31.950 --> 03:39.180
a paragraph and I believe I did Latham did 40 sounds about right.

03:39.180 --> 03:49.200
So large 40 and underneath the paragraph we're gonna have a div in this div is gonna have whatever buttons

03:49.200 --> 03:49.590
there are.

03:49.590 --> 03:53.490
Now on the first page we're just going to have one button because it's just a next.

03:53.490 --> 03:57.660
There's no previous words that were on the first page so let's do an A tag.

03:57.660 --> 04:03.030
Let's give it a class of B10 because we're gonna style that and then this is going to go to the I.D.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.160
of page dash.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.700
Okay.

04:06.810 --> 04:13.210
And then inside here let's say next page now we are gonna be using font.

04:13.230 --> 04:13.770
Awesome.

04:13.770 --> 04:22.560
So I'm actually going to go to font awesome dot com and we're gonna grab the link here so that we can

04:22.560 --> 04:28.070
use these icons so let's put this right above our link to our style sheet.

04:28.240 --> 04:28.710
Excuse me.

04:30.180 --> 04:30.920
OK.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.030
Now we should be able to use icons.

04:33.030 --> 04:42.840
So I'm going to go after the text of next page and when to put an eye tag with a class of f a s let's

04:42.840 --> 04:51.700
do a class of F A Dash arrow dash circle dash down.

04:51.940 --> 04:54.840
OK so that will give us a down facing arrow.

04:54.840 --> 05:00.430
So if I save this and we open this with live server we're gonna see something like this.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.790
So notice the the arrow coming from font.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.320
Awesome.

05:04.390 --> 05:12.130
So for the next page I'm going to copy this whole section and go right under it.

05:12.130 --> 05:16.260
And this is gonna be page two and get rid of that.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.070
And this is gonna have an idea of page two.

05:19.420 --> 05:24.390
And for the title or the H1 I should say I'm just gonna say page two.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.900
I'm going to leave the same text.

05:25.900 --> 05:31.300
Obviously it would be different content if this were a real life project and then down here the next.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.960
This is going to have this go to the previous page.

05:34.170 --> 05:39.780
I you know what I'll do is just copy the entire a tag here and paste it under.

05:39.940 --> 05:48.190
And this one is gonna go to page one and this is going to say previous or prev page and then for the

05:48.190 --> 05:56.220
icon it's gonna be f a circle up and then this one here is gonna go to page three and this is gonna

05:56.230 --> 05:59.310
be circled down and it's going to go to the next page.

05:59.350 --> 06:00.700
OK so now it's copy.

06:00.700 --> 06:06.280
Page 2 Copy that section paste that in.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.730
This is going to be page three.

06:08.920 --> 06:15.020
Change that all to page 3 and then as for the previous it's going to go to page 2 and this is going

06:15.020 --> 06:17.610
to go to page 4.

06:17.900 --> 06:18.960
All right.

06:19.120 --> 06:27.060
Actually one thing I wanted to do is for the see for the previous page button.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.060
Let's let's give.

06:28.060 --> 06:33.450
Also give that a class of button dark because I don't want them to be the same color.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.830
So that'll be button dark.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.340
This one.

06:35.340 --> 06:39.020
Also button dark.

06:39.530 --> 06:39.880
All right.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.150
And then we have one more page to do so.

06:43.150 --> 06:52.690
Paste this in this would be page 4 given an idea of page 4 and then the previous is gonna be page 3

06:53.380 --> 06:58.060
and then we're not going to have a next so we can we can get rid of the this whole tag

07:01.420 --> 07:02.010
all right.

07:02.100 --> 07:06.190
And let's see.

07:06.400 --> 07:11.010
We won't do the button dark here just because it's the only button.

07:11.070 --> 07:11.340
All right.

07:11.350 --> 07:12.320
So going to save that.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.450
And that's what that's what we're gonna get.

07:14.490 --> 07:19.220
And you can see just how much CSX does because this is the H Tim Allen.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.610
And just look at this.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.180
It's absolutely horrible.

07:22.620 --> 07:28.770
So CSX is very important when it comes to shaping up a website or an application.

07:28.770 --> 07:32.760
So that's the Tim Allen the next video we're gonna start on the CSX.
