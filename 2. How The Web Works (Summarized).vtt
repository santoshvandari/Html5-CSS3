WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:04.980
All right so before we get started I feel like it's important that you know at least the basic idea

00:05.370 --> 00:09.890
of how the process of getting and loading a web page in your browser works.

00:09.900 --> 00:14.880
So for some of you this may be very simple you may already know this stuff for some of you this may

00:14.880 --> 00:20.790
be very confusing and daunting if it is confusing just know that you'll understand this process more

00:20.790 --> 00:25.500
as time goes on and you don't need to know it to start building Web sites.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.100
I think a good metaphor for this is that you don't need to know how an engine works to be able to to

00:30.180 --> 00:35.280
learn how to drive a car and the stuff that I'm going to talk about here in this in this section.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.590
It all happens under the hood.

00:37.590 --> 00:41.700
So if you're a beginner and you're just stepping into this world don't worry if you don't understand

00:41.700 --> 00:42.200
this stuff.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.900
I just think it's important to mention before we start.

00:45.900 --> 00:46.130
All right.

00:46.140 --> 00:50.670
So we all use the Internet every day but most people don't know how it actually works.

00:50.700 --> 00:56.310
And they just know they go to you know Facebook dot com or whatever and it loads their profile their

00:56.310 --> 00:57.450
social media.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.740
So I'm going to try to explain what actually goes on under the hood in very simple terms.

01:02.820 --> 01:08.520
Basically the internet is a global network of computers and devices and these computers have what's

01:08.520 --> 01:14.450
called an IP address to uniquely identify them just like an actual address for your home.

01:14.700 --> 01:20.490
And these IP addresses they're assigned to you by your Internet service providers and they're usually

01:20.490 --> 01:26.580
in the form of four numbers with dots in between just like this here and now this is a version for IP

01:26.580 --> 01:27.000
address.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.670
There's also Version 6 IP addresses that are much longer and these were created for when we run out

01:32.670 --> 01:38.550
of version for IP addresses and you can actually go to Google and just search what's my IP and you'll

01:38.550 --> 01:43.590
find different sites that will actually trace it and show it to you if you want to know what your current

01:43.590 --> 01:45.160
IP addresses.

01:45.180 --> 01:50.700
Now even if you have multiple devices in your home like let's say you have two computers a tablet a

01:50.700 --> 01:57.810
mobile device each of these devices they all have what's called a private IP address that is only local

01:57.810 --> 02:05.940
to your network your home network your router however has a public IP address and that's the IP address

02:05.940 --> 02:10.110
that the Internet actually sees all the private ones for each device.

02:10.170 --> 02:15.480
That's only within your home network or Europe in your office network whatever it may be.

02:15.480 --> 02:15.780
All right.

02:15.780 --> 02:22.800
Now the way that computers talk to each other is over something called the T C.P. IP protocol and a

02:22.800 --> 02:29.040
protocol is basically just a way for computers to communicate almost like a language that's so they

02:29.040 --> 02:30.360
can speak to each other.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.000
Don't worry too much about this.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.530
If you're getting into computer networking and stuff like that it's very important to understand the

02:37.530 --> 02:41.090
different network layers and so on how data packets are sent.

02:41.190 --> 02:45.870
But that's not important for what we're doing here or even to become a web developer.

02:46.560 --> 02:53.870
Now HDP is a little more important for you to understand this stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.110
And if you notice when you type in a Web site you are all like Google dot com Facebook.

02:59.190 --> 03:08.220
You're usually doing it HDP or H TTP S. HDP S is for secure connections using an SSL certificate.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.040
And we'll talk more about that later.

03:10.110 --> 03:17.370
But basically HDP is what's called an application layer protocol and it actually runs over TCB and it's

03:17.370 --> 03:24.180
responsible for handling web traffic between a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox and a web server

03:24.180 --> 03:26.160
that stores a Web site.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.990
And we'll talk more about that in the next slide.

03:29.010 --> 03:33.030
So HDP is one of many types of application layer protocols.

03:33.030 --> 03:36.810
You also have for instance S.M. A.P. which deals with e-mail.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.650
You have FTC and SSA each.

03:38.670 --> 03:45.000
These these deal with transferring files over the Internet HDP however is going to be the one you deal

03:45.000 --> 03:47.080
with the most in web development.

03:47.940 --> 03:54.090
So Web sites and Web pages are basically just files that are stored on computers that run a piece of

03:54.090 --> 03:56.220
software called a web server.

03:56.220 --> 04:00.090
And an example of a web server would be Apache or engine x.

04:00.150 --> 04:05.310
Don't worry if you've never heard of these before technically you could run a web server from your home

04:05.340 --> 04:06.440
on a computer.

04:06.540 --> 04:11.550
But most ISP prohibit doing that and you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways because if for some

04:11.550 --> 04:15.120
reason the computer shuts off or something happens your Web site goes down.

04:15.420 --> 04:21.300
So what you usually do is you you can build a Web site on your local machine at your home or office

04:21.540 --> 04:28.560
and then you would upload it to a hosting company K or to a server that a hosting company owns and there's

04:28.560 --> 04:33.750
all different types of hosting accounts you can actually get a dedicated server which is an actual computer

04:33.750 --> 04:36.320
that's dedicated to to you for your use.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.660
But those are really expensive.

04:38.730 --> 04:44.320
You have shared hosting where you share accounts on one server with other people.

04:44.340 --> 04:50.250
This is this is much cheaper and I'll go over the different types of hosting in a later section but

04:50.250 --> 04:53.300
that's basically what you're going to do is use a hosting company.

04:53.430 --> 04:59.740
And in addition to that you're going to need a domain name which can be a dot com dot net dawg and many

04:59.740 --> 05:01.480
other tell these now.

05:01.570 --> 05:07.420
Remember all computers including web servers have an IP address but it would really suck if you wanted

05:07.420 --> 05:14.480
to go to Facebook or Google and you had to remember something like 7 5 2 2 1 2 8 1 3 1.

05:14.530 --> 05:22.540
So what happens is when you type in for instance HDP colon slash slash W WW w dot Facebook dot com there's

05:22.540 --> 05:28.960
something called a DNS or a domain name service that actually maps that domain to the correct IP address

05:28.960 --> 05:32.080
of Facebook dot com or whatever website you're visiting.

05:32.140 --> 05:37.790
And this makes our lives much easier otherwise you'd probably have to have a notebook with you know

05:37.810 --> 05:41.470
hundreds of numbers for each Web site that you want to visit.

05:41.470 --> 05:46.630
So later on I'm actually going to show you how to register a domain name and how to upload a Web site

05:46.660 --> 05:49.720
to a Web hosting account.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.050
All right.

05:50.050 --> 05:55.910
So let's take a quick look at a diagram that kind of explains what we've been talking about.

05:56.020 --> 06:01.840
So you the user down at the bottom types in let's say Google dot com into a web browser and this could

06:01.840 --> 06:09.550
be Microsoft Edge Google Chrome Firefox Safari any web browser and the DNS server looks at the domain

06:09.550 --> 06:14.170
names such as Google dot com and it maps it to the IP address that's needed.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.810
As you can see right here.

06:15.930 --> 06:16.200
OK.

06:16.240 --> 06:23.740
Once it gets that IP address it then makes a what's called an H GDP request to the web server of that

06:23.740 --> 06:31.390
IP address and then that web server will return it will return a response with the html file that needs

06:31.390 --> 06:36.790
to be load any other files including C Ss files which are used for styling.

06:36.790 --> 06:42.730
You have any images that that are on the page those will get sent and whatever else is needed for Google

06:42.730 --> 06:45.340
dot com to be loaded in your browser.

06:45.340 --> 06:51.160
Now these HDP requests They're made when you load a web page as well as when you for instance submit

06:51.160 --> 06:52.150
a form.

06:52.330 --> 06:56.510
And there's different types of requests there's different status codes but that's all stuff you're going

06:56.510 --> 07:00.100
to learn later on when you get into scripting and programming.

07:00.100 --> 07:05.930
You don't need to know that stuff to create basic static web pages with each team Alan CSX.

07:06.300 --> 07:12.550
OK so this is obviously a very brief summary and there's a lot more that goes into it it's much more

07:12.550 --> 07:15.250
intricate when you get into networking layers and so on.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.820
But that again that's not stuff that you guys need to know right now.

07:18.850 --> 07:23.980
One thing about web development in general is it can be very overwhelming because there's just so many

07:23.980 --> 07:26.180
different technologies to learn.

07:26.440 --> 07:33.360
But H.C. Mellon CSX the they are the building blocks of all Web sites and web applications.

07:33.370 --> 07:38.020
So in the next video I want to talk more about the roles of each team Alan CSX.
