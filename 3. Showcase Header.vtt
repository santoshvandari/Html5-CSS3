WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:03.110
All right guys next we're going to work on the showcase area.

00:03.130 --> 00:05.270
Now we have our nav bar up here.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.210
So right under the NAV it's got a comment.

00:08.220 --> 00:17.130
And let's just say header showcase really use the HMO five semantic header tag and it's actually given

00:17.130 --> 00:19.950
an idea of showcase.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.030
We don't want to do that.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.610
This doesn't make any sense does it.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.110
I.D. equals showcase.

00:27.230 --> 00:27.480
OK.

00:27.510 --> 00:32.890
So in here we're gonna have a class of showcase dash content.

00:32.940 --> 00:38.820
I want to wrap all the content in that div because this is actually going to be a flex container even

00:38.820 --> 00:44.520
though the elements are gonna be in a column going vertical we still we're still gonna use flex here

00:45.350 --> 00:50.820
and then we're gonna put an H one and I want this H1 to be extra large so I'm actually going to have

00:50.820 --> 00:57.120
a utility class called l dash heading and you're gonna see a lot of similarities through our projects

00:57.120 --> 00:57.690
just different.

00:57.720 --> 01:03.810
Just the neat the ways that I name utility classes and so on and I mean you might come up with different

01:03.810 --> 01:11.250
things but I think everyone has you know their their core class names just the way that they do things

01:11.250 --> 01:17.130
everyone's different and I'm kind of showing you mine and you can adapt it or you can use your own it's

01:17.160 --> 01:19.290
you know whatever you whatever you feel comfortable with.

01:19.740 --> 01:29.670
So we're gonna say the sky is the limit and underneath the h 1 let's put a paragraph from when you use

01:29.670 --> 01:39.150
the class of lead and we're gonna say Lorem 15 who put 15 words in here and under the paragraph we're

01:39.150 --> 01:43.400
going to have an A tag with the class of B.T. and so we can style it.

01:43.440 --> 01:48.500
And it's going to go to idea of what and we're just going to say read more.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.090
OK so we'll just click it and I'll take it.

01:51.150 --> 01:53.880
Take them to the what we do section.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.390
So let's save this.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.890
And this looks like this for now.

01:58.890 --> 02:10.580
So let's head over to our style sheet and let's see let's add comment we'll see a showcase case source.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.900
And we're gonna style the showcase area.

02:13.650 --> 02:18.440
Let's start off with the showcase idea itself.

02:21.670 --> 02:25.780
So for that we're gonna add a background.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.600
This is where we want to add the background image.

02:28.600 --> 02:34.330
So let's do let's do a color of three three three and then we'll do the U.R.L. will do the image over

02:34.330 --> 02:39.670
it which is going to be we want to go dot dot slash because right now we're in the CSX folder we need

02:39.670 --> 02:45.440
to navigate out of it and then into the image folder and then we want showcase dot j peg.

02:45.700 --> 02:46.120
Okay.

02:46.120 --> 02:53.500
And then after that I'm probably gonna have to make this a little bigger after that.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.880
Let's do a no repeat.

02:57.190 --> 03:05.810
And we also want to do center center and we want it to cover the entire area.

03:06.310 --> 03:12.100
Now we've we've gone over this before when we looked at VH units.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.740
It's only going to cover the content.

03:14.830 --> 03:19.480
OK so as far as the content reaches which is to this link it's going to cover that but we wanted to

03:19.480 --> 03:29.770
cover the whole viewport as far as the height goes so let's say we want the height to be 100 VH and

03:29.770 --> 03:30.510
save.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.710
And now it's going to cover the whole viewport.

03:32.740 --> 03:37.240
Now it is going to go a little lower because we have the the menu above it.

03:37.270 --> 03:43.060
So it's basically going to add that spacing there which I don't see a problem you could add a negative

03:43.060 --> 03:49.240
margin if you wanted to kind of pull it up a little bit and kind replace the the menu here but I'm not

03:49.240 --> 03:51.470
going to do that I think that this is fine.

03:51.700 --> 03:58.210
And then let's make the color of everything white and that's inside the showcase all right.

03:58.210 --> 04:00.400
So now we'll do the showcase content.

04:00.400 --> 04:09.120
I'm just gonna make this a little smaller again so make sure this isn't what's size.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.620
Let's say that should be fine.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.140
Well we'll make this a little smaller

04:15.540 --> 04:15.810
All right.

04:15.840 --> 04:26.660
So let's do the showcase content so we have the I.D. showcase and then we have the class showcase content.

04:28.230 --> 04:31.380
So like I said we're going to display flex.

04:31.380 --> 04:37.800
Now as soon as I save that the default is to do a flex row which is horizontal.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.620
Now we don't want that we want a column.

04:39.630 --> 04:45.410
So we're going to add in flex direction column as soon as I do that.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.850
It'll go back to being vertical.

04:47.850 --> 04:53.160
Now we want to align the items center both vertical and horizontal.

04:53.250 --> 04:57.150
So we want it centered this way and this way.

04:57.180 --> 05:03.330
So we're going to use both justified content text a line and a line items.

05:03.360 --> 05:03.590
OK.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.770
So let's first to the text.

05:05.910 --> 05:17.450
So text align center OK and then we're also going to do a line dash actually to justify first or justify

05:17.480 --> 05:20.510
content center.

05:20.510 --> 05:32.660
Now if I do a line dash items center and save notice that it didn't it didn't center it vertically.

05:32.690 --> 05:37.610
The reason for that is there's no height on the Flex container the showcase content.

05:37.610 --> 05:44.360
There is a height on the Showcase which is 100 viewport heights but not on the actual flex container.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.910
So we do have to add a height here.

05:47.090 --> 05:50.730
And for the height I'm going to say I want it to be 100 percent of its container.

05:50.870 --> 05:56.900
So 100 percent of the showcase which is 100 viewport heights once I save that then it will go to the

05:56.900 --> 06:00.170
middle or to the center.

06:00.170 --> 06:06.390
And let's see I'm also going to add some padding here.

06:06.770 --> 06:14.920
Let's do padding zero and then let's do two ram on the left and right and save that.

06:14.920 --> 06:19.130
So that will that should bring in away from the sides a little bit.

06:19.160 --> 06:31.110
Now for the overlay we're going to basically we're going to position this absolute so that we can cover

06:31.120 --> 06:34.410
the entire thing the entire showcase content.

06:34.530 --> 06:46.770
So let's put out a comment here and say overlay and let's to position absolutes and let's say we want

06:46.770 --> 06:50.130
the high already did 100 percent height.

06:50.370 --> 06:51.150
Let's set.

06:51.600 --> 07:00.030
Basically we wanted to start and see let's do top.

07:00.050 --> 07:07.040
Now if I do top zero this is the thing since it's absolute top zero is going to start at the very top

07:07.130 --> 07:10.340
meaning above the the the nav bar.

07:10.340 --> 07:14.470
So let me just show you the top bottom.

07:14.480 --> 07:28.090
Let's just do top left zero and let's add a background dash color and we can use our G.B. a.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.990
So this is red green blue Alpha.

07:29.990 --> 07:37.470
Basically we can do our G.B. so the red green blue values and then Alpha is actually the transparency.

07:37.520 --> 07:37.870
OK.

07:37.880 --> 07:46.820
So I want it to be black with a transparency which goes between 0 1 1 0 0 0 point 1 zero point two all

07:46.820 --> 07:53.530
the way up to 1 which is no transparency at all so black would be all zeros red green blue and then

07:53.750 --> 07:58.180
the opacity or the the alpha transparency whatever you want to call it.

07:58.190 --> 08:04.850
If we said 1 and we save it's just going to there's there's no transparency at all if I do zero point

08:04.850 --> 08:10.490
nine there'll be a little bit transparent as you can see I want zero point four I think that's a good

08:10.940 --> 08:11.900
value.

08:11.900 --> 08:17.970
And now notice that there's it's darker over the image but the text isn't OK.

08:18.020 --> 08:25.710
So we if we just set no positive value on the showcase content the text would also have that opacity

08:25.710 --> 08:28.870
and we don't want that we'd only want the background to have it.

08:28.940 --> 08:35.150
Now as you can see there's some there's some area here that's not covered and that's because of the

08:35.150 --> 08:38.990
nav bar the way that we did this to incorporate the sticky menu.

08:39.110 --> 08:45.370
We have to kind of add a couple that are really hacks but just extra things that we have to do.

08:45.440 --> 08:52.070
So instead of doing top zero I'm going to say top sixty five pixels because that's the the exact number

08:52.070 --> 08:53.890
of pixels of the menu.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.340
So let's save that.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.110
And now you can see that.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.580
It goes all the way.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.460
Actually I think I did a little too much.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.370
Let's do 60 CEO Seo we have this little spacing up here.

09:06.450 --> 09:11.730
Sixty three gnome 60 and yet so that should be good.

09:11.730 --> 09:17.850
Now we have the overlay once we have our responsive our mobile dot CSF CSX we'll have to tweak it a

09:17.850 --> 09:24.420
little bit in the media query because the manual will reach down further because remember that the links

09:24.420 --> 09:29.670
get put under the logo and if you don't want to have the overlay that's fine if you don't want to deal

09:29.670 --> 09:33.200
with the extra properties and hassle you have to.

09:33.210 --> 09:36.600
But I think it makes the text a little more readable.

09:36.720 --> 09:43.740
So next thing I want to do is is this content here which we have a bunch utility classes.

09:43.830 --> 09:53.310
The heading has a class of L dash headings so let's go up to our utilities are and let's add L or class

09:53.340 --> 09:58.080
of L heading.

09:58.230 --> 10:04.530
Let's see the font size for the al heading is going to be for RAM

10:08.030 --> 10:09.710
for RAM.

10:09.850 --> 10:10.640
Save that.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.840
That gets much bigger.

10:11.870 --> 10:25.490
Let's also let's do a margin bottom and for the margin bottom let's do zero point seventy five Ram.

10:25.490 --> 10:31.460
And then I also want a line height of one point one.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.780
So save that.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.630
And if something I do if it doesn't look right to you.

10:35.630 --> 10:41.180
Like if you want less margin or more margin or padding or something feel free to ta ta to mess with

10:41.180 --> 10:41.980
it.

10:42.170 --> 10:44.810
And then this paragraph has a class of lead.

10:44.900 --> 10:53.800
So let's add our class of lead here they're going to set the font size number one room is 16 pixels

10:53.800 --> 11:00.360
I'm going to do one point three ram make it a little bigger and then let's add some margin bottom let's

11:00.400 --> 11:03.900
two to room margin bottom.

11:04.250 --> 11:04.780
Okay.

11:04.780 --> 11:14.980
And then this has a class of B T N so it's do B T N and I wanted to display as an inline block

11:18.370 --> 11:23.140
and I want to add some actually to the color.

11:23.140 --> 11:30.580
So the color is gonna be white and then the background is gonna be that green color which is hexadecimal

11:30.730 --> 11:37.760
and it's gonna be 9 three C B five two.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.340
OK so save that.

11:39.340 --> 11:45.150
We also want some padding for the padding I'm going to do zero point five Ram.

11:45.160 --> 11:53.100
Top and bottom and two Ram left and right and let's do.

11:53.300 --> 11:53.890
Let's see.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.730
Let's do a border.

11:56.030 --> 11:56.690
None.

11:56.690 --> 12:02.540
Because if we happen to add this class to an actual button that's not a link.

12:02.540 --> 12:11.180
Those have borders but we want to remove them but we do want rounded corners so let's do border radius

12:11.380 --> 12:14.180
five pixels.

12:14.420 --> 12:15.920
There we go.

12:15.920 --> 12:20.440
Now I do want to have a hover state so that it changes a little bit on hover.

12:20.510 --> 12:33.510
So let's go over it under it and let's say Beatty and hover and let's set the background to.

12:33.530 --> 12:34.500
Now the background.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.200
It's just gonna be a bit lighter than that green.

12:37.490 --> 12:45.640
I think it's lighter it might be darker but it's seven A B four three six.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.310
And that's all we want is to change the background.

12:48.350 --> 12:48.620
Yeah.

12:48.650 --> 12:51.640
So if I hover over it it gets a little darker.

12:51.740 --> 13:02.420
Now we're also going to add a Beatty and Beatty and dark class and give that a background of dark gray

13:02.810 --> 13:05.820
and a color of white.

13:05.870 --> 13:09.400
In case you want to use that class later.

13:09.410 --> 13:13.230
So I think that that's it for the showcase area.

13:13.640 --> 13:20.570
Actually one more thing I wanted to add on that I forgot was a line height for the body.

13:21.190 --> 13:23.780
So I'm going to do line height one point four.

13:24.260 --> 13:24.710
All right.

13:24.710 --> 13:29.600
That all just you know I think it looks cleaner because it separates the lines a little bit but in the

13:29.600 --> 13:32.440
next video we're going to start on the boxes.

13:32.440 --> 13:32.630
OK.

13:32.660 --> 13:37.910
So we're gonna use flex for that as well and we may move on to the next section we'll see how much time

13:37.910 --> 13:38.570
we have.

13:38.570 --> 13:38.800
All right.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.000
So I'll see you in the next video.
