00:00.210 --> 00:06.870
All right so our project is is pretty much done for just regular screen sizes.

00:07.020 --> 00:11.890
But in this video I want to tackle wide screens and just tablets.

00:11.910 --> 00:16.030
And then in the next video we'll deal with smaller mobile devices.

00:16.110 --> 00:25.650
So on wide screens and on tablets I want the the icon here to to basically align to the left.

00:25.650 --> 00:31.800
So I want to turn each item into a flex container so that they go horizontal.

00:31.800 --> 00:37.670
This div and this icon are horizontal even know these are flex items themselves.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.900
They can also be flex containers.

00:39.900 --> 00:46.020
So let's head over actually one thing I want to do before that and then we should have did this in the

00:46.020 --> 00:46.950
beginning.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.170
So we have this style CSM and below the mobile on the wide screen.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.070
We don't want to do that.

00:52.070 --> 00:56.440
We want the original style sheet above those two.

00:56.460 --> 01:03.980
So I'm going to go ahead and just control C copy this and delete it and then move it above the wide

01:03.980 --> 01:06.980
screen and the Mobile case.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.160
We're going to do that and save.

01:09.510 --> 01:18.390
Otherwise the the styles from style C CSX are gonna overwrite what we have in here unless we use important

01:18.390 --> 01:20.830
tags which I don't want to put all over the place.

01:20.910 --> 01:21.930
So let's do that.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.780
Let's open up wide screen dots.

01:23.830 --> 01:31.110
SS And like I said I want to turn each of these items into a flex container so that these are aligned

01:31.380 --> 01:32.360
horizontally.

01:32.370 --> 01:45.680
So to do that let's let's put a comment here we'll say a line icon to left so we'll take the what I

01:45.730 --> 01:50.720
I.D. the items and then the item itself.

01:50.730 --> 01:51.160
OK.

01:51.190 --> 01:54.320
Because each of these have a class of item.

01:54.430 --> 01:56.180
We're going to turn it into a flex block.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.650
So display flex and save.

01:59.650 --> 02:00.270
And notice that.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.850
Now they align this way and don't worry about this we're going to fix that.

02:05.140 --> 02:11.710
Now I want the text now to align to the left not the center.

02:11.710 --> 02:19.720
So let's say text a line to the left and save that.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.890
There we go.

02:20.890 --> 02:32.200
Now for the icon we're gonna do some stuff with that so let's target the icon save position icon.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.390
So we want the what I.D. then items.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.180
Then item and then the eye.

02:40.240 --> 02:40.590
OK.

02:40.600 --> 02:46.540
Because that's that's where that the icon classes and first of all I'm going to add a margin to the

02:46.540 --> 02:50.320
right of one point three REM.

02:50.410 --> 02:57.310
Because as you can see there's no spacing right here so now we're taking this this icon and we're putting

02:57.310 --> 02:58.350
some margin on the right.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.080
So I save the seconds pushed over.

03:01.080 --> 03:01.240
OK.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.940
Another thing I want to do is fix this.

03:03.940 --> 03:06.310
I want to align this in the middle.

03:06.310 --> 03:14.080
So we're going to use the aligned dash self and we want to set that to center and save.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.270
And now that puts that in the center.

03:16.270 --> 03:20.470
And this by default has some margin bottom just from when we had it on the top.

03:20.470 --> 03:26.280
So I'm going to clear that by just saying margin bottom and zero.

03:27.610 --> 03:28.000
OK.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.760
So I think that looks pretty good.

03:30.790 --> 03:37.480
And another thing I want to do on wide screens is I don't want the map in the form to be even I want

03:37.480 --> 03:39.770
the map to take up more space.

03:39.790 --> 03:46.160
So if you remember we have flex one for both of these in fact I'll show you in style CSX.

03:46.330 --> 03:54.280
If we go down here we have flex one for both the map and the contact form so on wide screens I'm going

03:54.280 --> 04:02.620
to take the map and I'm going to add Flex 2 and save.

04:02.620 --> 04:05.410
And now you can see that the map is wider.

04:05.410 --> 04:12.310
And then when I get below eleven hundred it goes back to being even now on small screens and we get

04:12.310 --> 04:13.510
to 768.

04:13.510 --> 04:20.740
I also want I want these to stack on top of each other but I also want them to have the icon on the

04:20.770 --> 04:22.970
left just like with wide screens.

04:23.050 --> 04:29.440
So I'm actually going to copy these two styles here and put them into mobile dots.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.820
SS OK.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.460
Now if I save it it's going to look like that which doesn't look good because we need to stack these

04:36.460 --> 04:41.710
on top of each other meaning we have to remove the flex so right up here.

04:41.710 --> 04:48.170
Let's target what items.

04:48.700 --> 05:00.970
And initially we had it set to flex but now we want to basically clear that flex and say display block

05:02.230 --> 05:03.610
so we'll save that.

05:03.610 --> 05:09.930
Let's add a little bit of a padding one room and there he goes.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.970
Now they're stacked and that looks pretty good.

05:13.740 --> 05:14.940
I mean you could keep it.

05:15.120 --> 05:21.150
He could keep these in the middle like if we remove this and we save.

05:21.150 --> 05:27.050
He could have that but I honestly think that this looks better now.

05:27.060 --> 05:33.360
Every other style that we do in the mobile dot CSX I want to be four or five hundred pixels or less

05:33.390 --> 05:37.440
because tablets tablets should look fine.

05:37.440 --> 05:45.210
In fact if we go ahead and look at our mobile view here with our chrome tools iPhone obviously this

05:45.210 --> 05:45.930
doesn't look good.

05:45.930 --> 05:50.400
The menu doesn't this doesn't this doesn't.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.350
We're gonna have to fix all this stuff.

05:52.350 --> 05:59.190
But for the iPad I think things look pretty good.

05:59.190 --> 06:05.760
It's big enough it's wide enough to keep this flex here and here the menu looks good.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.950
We can even add more links.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.810
And yeah I think that's fine.

06:09.810 --> 06:17.860
So in the next video we're going to target you know iPhone apps iPhone X 6 7 8.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.920
And if it does this with this this side here I'm not sure why that happens.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.720
But notice if I just re save my file that goes away.

06:26.730 --> 06:29.440
So I'm not sure what that is it's some kind of bug.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.290
But yeah I'm gonna just clear this up.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.990
And in the next video we're gonna start to work on basically you know smaller screens that are under

06:39.990 --> 06:40.760
500.

06:40.770 --> 06:45.380
So we're gonna add a media query here for that and we'll put our all of our styles in there.
