00:00.320 --> 00:03.620
All right guys so we're going to jump right in and start to learn aged him out.

00:03.630 --> 00:10.020
We're gonna learn all the important age HTML5 tags attributes we'll learn how to insert images into

00:10.020 --> 00:16.110
pages links form stuff like that and I realize that a lot of you guys probably already know some of

00:16.110 --> 00:16.520
this stuff.

00:16.530 --> 00:22.260
So feel free to skip around skip some videos if you want to skip this whole section altogether that's

00:22.260 --> 00:23.340
fine.

00:23.340 --> 00:30.840
Later on after section three we'll be getting into like CSX grid and flex blocks and animations and

00:30.840 --> 00:32.470
more difficult stuff.

00:32.580 --> 00:38.880
But again I want this course to be very friendly for absolute beginners that have never even touched

00:38.880 --> 00:40.500
aged him out before.

00:40.500 --> 00:46.350
OK so let's go ahead and create a new folder for our aged him all files so we'll just go ahead and right

00:46.350 --> 00:52.510
click and say new folder and I'm going to rename this to h t AML sandbox.

00:52.740 --> 01:00.960
And the idea here is for every section or every video I should say we're gonna be touching on a different

01:00.960 --> 01:01.590
topic.

01:01.620 --> 01:07.110
So for instance we'll look at like links and images and a video will look at forms and input and I want

01:07.110 --> 01:12.780
to have a separate file for each video and create a sandbox that you can use as a reference if you need

01:12.780 --> 01:18.750
to go back to it later on to see how it how a tag is structured or what attributes it takes.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.010
Things like that.

01:20.010 --> 01:20.260
OK.

01:20.310 --> 01:26.940
So let's go ahead and open this up in V.S. code in Visual Studio code and there's a few ways to do that.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.610
If you're on Windows you should be able to right click and say open with code you can do it that way.

01:32.730 --> 01:38.880
If you're on a Mac you can drag it down to your VSO code icon in your bar down below or you can just

01:38.910 --> 01:42.870
open up V.S. code and just click open folder and then search for it.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.790
So mine's on my desktop.

01:44.790 --> 01:48.540
There it is each team sandbox and I'll go ahead and open.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.270
All right so we can close this up.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.750
And now on the side you can see the HDMI sandbox folder is open.

01:54.960 --> 02:00.540
So let's go ahead and create our first h t AML file and I'm basically going to create a file called

02:00.600 --> 02:05.510
index dot HDMI all comma but dot HDMI all.

02:05.610 --> 02:11.970
Now there's something really important for Windows users if you are seeing a dot t XY here after the

02:11.970 --> 02:13.160
dot each time l.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.340
Then you have to actually change something in your folder settings.

02:17.340 --> 02:17.640
All right.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.460
So I have a screenshot here.

02:19.620 --> 02:24.690
If you're on Windows and you're seeing a dot t x t you should check this anyways to make sure that this

02:24.690 --> 02:26.250
box is unchecked.

02:26.250 --> 02:32.910
What you want to do is go to your view tab in your your file manager and go to options right here and

02:32.910 --> 02:35.500
then click change folder and search options.

02:35.580 --> 02:40.500
You'll get a box like this that pops up and you want to click the View tab and make sure that this is

02:40.530 --> 02:41.160
unchecked.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.110
This Hide extensions for known file types.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.630
You want it to show the file extension.

02:47.850 --> 02:51.860
So just just make sure that that's unchecked if you're on Windows.

02:51.870 --> 02:52.130
All right.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.310
So I just wanted to mention that you don't run into problems.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.270
So now we have an HD e-mail file.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.930
So what do we do with this.

02:58.950 --> 03:05.040
We need to put in what's called an h t email tag K so each team all files are full of h t mail tags

03:05.400 --> 03:07.440
which surround content.

03:07.470 --> 03:11.700
So let's take a look at how each team all tags are actually formatted.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.550
So elements are surrounded in angle brackets.

03:14.550 --> 03:18.370
So basically this the the less than and greater than signs.

03:18.390 --> 03:23.580
So the element here for example is an H1 and different elements do different things.

03:23.580 --> 03:24.830
This is a heading tag.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.340
There's actually H1 through age 6 and I'm going to go over that in another video.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.100
But basically this will make this text much bigger.

03:32.270 --> 03:38.940
OK this here is a paragraph tag which is just four paragraphs just regular sized text.

03:38.940 --> 03:45.450
And notice that there's an opening tag and there's a closing tag or a start and an end tag and the end

03:45.450 --> 03:47.550
tag has a forward slash.

03:47.610 --> 03:47.900
OK.

03:47.910 --> 03:50.520
So that's how you identify the ending tag.

03:50.520 --> 03:57.630
Now there are some self closing tags for stuff that doesn't have content inside of it like the H1 in

03:57.630 --> 03:58.380
the paragraph.

03:58.380 --> 04:02.580
They have content inside the bizarre tag is actually just a line break.

04:02.580 --> 04:04.520
So it just kind of skips a line.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.320
So there's no need to put any content inside of it.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.450
So it's a self closing tag it doesn't need an ending tag.

04:11.460 --> 04:19.170
Now notice that this one has a slash in this one doesn't this is actually a remnant of x h t AML which

04:19.170 --> 04:21.240
is a derivative of HCM.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.450
And it's not used that much anymore.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.460
Each 5 is definitely the standard.

04:26.460 --> 04:30.970
That's what you want to learn in HMO five you could use either of these.

04:30.990 --> 04:36.450
So you can use the x each team El version with the line or the slash but you don't need to.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.250
This would be just fine.

04:38.280 --> 04:38.570
OK.

04:38.580 --> 04:41.340
So this is how tags are structured.

04:41.430 --> 04:46.740
So what I'm going to do now is just put in a couple tags and I want to show you how to open an HMO file

04:46.740 --> 04:47.870
in the browser.

04:47.970 --> 04:53.160
So remember tags have an opening angle bracket and we'll do an H1 which is a heading.

04:53.190 --> 04:59.430
We'll close that H1 and with this code every text editor as is different with Visa's code it's going

04:59.430 --> 05:01.370
to the tag for you.

05:01.380 --> 05:01.700
OK.

05:01.710 --> 05:08.070
So notice that the ending tag was put in automatically which is very helpful and this code actually

05:08.070 --> 05:14.640
has a tool that comes pre installed called Emmett which you can use to type really fast each team Alan

05:14.660 --> 05:18.090
I'm going to show you some some tips and tricks with Emmett.

05:18.120 --> 05:26.250
As we move along so let's put something in here we'll just say welcome to my Web site and then we're

05:26.250 --> 05:30.500
gonna go on the next line and we're going to put a paragraph tag.

05:30.510 --> 05:37.500
Now remember we have Emmett installed in with him and we can just do PE because we want to p a paragraph

05:37.500 --> 05:41.970
tag with it which is a P and then we can hit enter or tab.

05:42.120 --> 05:45.960
You can do enter a tab and it will actually complete it for us.

05:46.020 --> 05:46.340
OK.

05:46.350 --> 05:52.080
So it makes it very easy if we want you know an H to tag we can do H to enter if we want.

05:52.080 --> 05:57.780
So let's say an image tag we can do I am G enter and that will actually give us the attributes that

05:57.780 --> 05:58.230
we need.

05:58.230 --> 06:00.920
I'm going to go over all this stuff later so don't worry about it.

06:01.080 --> 06:06.560
But just to show you that Emmett is very helpful and it allows you to write aged him out very fast.

06:06.560 --> 06:06.860
OK.

06:06.870 --> 06:15.510
So in the paragraph let's just say this is my very first Web site.

06:15.630 --> 06:15.930
OK.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.930
So we just have it heading tag and a paragraph.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.490
Let's go ahead and save this.

06:20.520 --> 06:26.940
You can either go to file save or you can just do control assets or command assets on a Mac and that

06:26.940 --> 06:28.040
will save the file.

06:28.550 --> 06:28.740
OK.

06:28.800 --> 06:35.640
So now let's go ahead and minimize this and let's go into our age team our sandbox folder and you can

06:35.640 --> 06:38.700
see we have our index start each team I'll file.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.010
Now you might have a different icon.

06:41.010 --> 06:47.070
It's probably going to be whatever your default browser is it could be Chrome or Safari or edge if you're

06:47.070 --> 06:48.060
on Windows.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.430
So you just want to open this with a browser.

06:50.550 --> 06:56.040
So I'm actually going to right click and just say open with Google Chrome which is my default browser

06:57.680 --> 06:58.480
and there it is.

06:58.490 --> 07:06.710
So you can see that the H One is a large heading and then the paragraph is just just normal sized text.

07:06.710 --> 07:11.290
But this is in fact an each team file you can see in the in the U.R.L. bar here.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.770
It gives us the full path.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.070
OK.

07:13.070 --> 07:20.610
Yours will probably be different but mine is in my desktop in HDMI sandbox and then index HD CML.

07:20.630 --> 07:25.040
Now of course when you upload this to a web host it'll be your domain name.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.930
So let's say you registered my Web site dot com which of course is already taken but we'll use that

07:29.930 --> 07:31.320
as an example.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.180
So this would be replace this file.

07:34.190 --> 07:38.070
This stuff here would all be replaced with whatever your domain is.

07:38.150 --> 07:45.860
Now there's a reason that I called that index each team L and this name here is significant because

07:45.860 --> 07:50.010
when you call it index dot h t AML This is your home page.

07:50.030 --> 07:55.070
If we were to upload this to a host with let's say my Web site dot com is the domain.

07:55.070 --> 07:59.260
If we go to my Web site dot com it's going to load the index page.

07:59.260 --> 07:59.490
OK.

07:59.510 --> 08:04.490
So it's very important to understand that whatever you want your home page you want to call that index

08:04.790 --> 08:07.330
and then any other page you can call whatever you want.

08:07.350 --> 08:12.340
Like let's say you had an about page that listed your company info or something like that.

08:12.500 --> 08:19.250
You could create an about Dot HCM out page upload it and then you would go to my Web site dot com slash

08:19.310 --> 08:25.200
about Dot HDMI all OK and that would load that but index is significant because that's always going

08:25.200 --> 08:27.090
to be your home page.

08:27.140 --> 08:27.430
All right.

08:27.450 --> 08:34.130
So now that we have created an age team I'll file and open it opened it with Chrome in the next video

08:34.130 --> 08:39.100
I'm going to show you how to correctly structure in each Tim I'll document because this isn't correct.

08:39.110 --> 08:43.600
There's some other things that we need to add in order for it to be valid.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.990
Each team I'll document.

08:44.990 --> 08:45.250
All right.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.670
So we'll get into that next.
