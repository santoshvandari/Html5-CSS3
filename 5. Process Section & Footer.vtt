WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:04.340
All right guys soon in this video we're gonna start to work on the rest of the index page.

00:04.350 --> 00:05.200
So we want this.

00:05.220 --> 00:10.650
This process my creative process and we want these font awesome icons.

00:10.650 --> 00:12.240
We want to add some background to it.

00:12.240 --> 00:19.650
This transition effect and get these numbers kind of inside of the the display of the icon.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.120
All right.

00:20.130 --> 00:24.790
And then we also do the footer as well with these social media icons with the hover effect.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.990
So we're going to start with each team Miles also let's jump into V.S. code and go to our index each

00:30.990 --> 00:38.580
team will go right below Section B which is the stats that we did in the last video and let's say section

00:38.890 --> 00:39.870
C..

00:39.960 --> 00:43.440
And this is the process section.

00:43.440 --> 00:53.400
So I'm going to give this a an idea of home dash see and let's give it a class of text center and also

00:53.400 --> 00:55.100
a class of P Y two.

00:55.110 --> 00:58.210
So do some padding on the top and bottom.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.060
We want our container.

01:00.180 --> 01:05.670
You can see there's a lot of repetitiveness in these sections.

01:05.670 --> 01:06.990
So we'll have each two.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.180
Let's give it a class of Section dash title which I believe we still have to add in the CSX and we're

01:14.180 --> 01:24.090
just going to see my creative process and let's put let's do a bottom line game and we have that bottom

01:24.090 --> 01:25.350
line class.

01:25.350 --> 01:30.180
So we'll do bottom line.

01:30.180 --> 01:34.850
And underneath that we're going to have a class a paragraph with the class of lead.

01:35.610 --> 01:38.460
And we're going to say actually you know what I'm going to do is just

01:41.100 --> 01:44.790
paste this in you guys can just copy it.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.580
So it's go right here.

01:47.580 --> 01:54.810
So all of my UI UX and design projects are based off of a practice formula to get the result I am looking

01:54.810 --> 01:55.970
for.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.720
And of course you can put whatever you'd like in here.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.980
I just wanted to make it a little more realistic.

02:00.990 --> 02:06.620
We are going to have some form of some content but I wanted to put some real text in here as well.

02:06.750 --> 02:12.980
So underneath this paragraph let's create a class called process.

02:13.650 --> 02:13.880
OK.

02:13.890 --> 02:22.320
Now this process is going to be the the four divs with the icons and the text and so on and so this

02:22.320 --> 02:23.100
right here.

02:23.100 --> 02:23.300
OK.

02:23.310 --> 02:29.370
So the process class will surround these and then will have the divs inside and we'll use the grid to

02:29.400 --> 02:29.970
align them.

02:31.020 --> 02:39.960
So let's go back and in process let's do div and we're gonna have our icons so we'll say I with the

02:39.960 --> 02:47.700
class of FH s and the icon we're gonna use as F A Dash file dash all right.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.530
And we want this to be four times its size so we're gonna say f or four times the regular default size.

02:55.530 --> 03:04.500
So for X and we're also going to add in here process dash icon which is a custom class I'm going to

03:04.500 --> 03:10.360
add and then I want to do the m y and when we did the margin classes for the top and bottom we're gonna

03:10.380 --> 03:12.240
do M Y two.

03:12.480 --> 03:17.030
Now inside here remember we want to have the numbers 1 2 3 4.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.470
Inside the icon.

03:19.470 --> 03:25.720
So we're gonna put a div inside here and let's give this a class of process.

03:25.920 --> 03:31.020
Dash step and going to put a number 1.

03:31.120 --> 03:31.500
Okay.

03:31.530 --> 03:42.450
Now underneath that C in what I'm gonna do here is I'm actually gonna float it because of the way that

03:42.480 --> 03:48.060
it's it's positioned so I'm gonna just put a clear class underneath this.

03:48.060 --> 03:56.190
OK so we're gonna put a clear class and then underneath that we're gonna have an H 3 and let's say discuss

03:57.570 --> 03:59.070
the project

04:02.380 --> 04:11.240
and then we'll put a paragraph and let's do Lorem think I did last 15 looks about right.

04:11.340 --> 04:11.610
Okay.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.070
So that's gonna be the first one first div.

04:14.110 --> 04:23.830
So I'm going to actually copy this whole div and let's put it in two three four times.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.660
OK I'm just gonna save it to format it with prettier.

04:26.710 --> 04:29.680
So the first one's all set which is this one.

04:29.710 --> 04:39.190
Now the second one is gonna have an icon of f a desktop OK and we want to keep these classes we just

04:39.190 --> 04:55.910
want to change this to two for the heading let's say we'll do brainstorming and concept and I'll just

04:55.910 --> 04:58.360
keep the same text OK.

04:58.370 --> 05:08.600
And then for this third one here the icon is gonna be F.A. dash object dash unwrap and then we want

05:08.600 --> 05:19.970
to change the step to three and then the title let's change that to UI dash or slash you X planning

05:21.610 --> 05:25.840
okay and then for the last one here we're gonna make this thumbs up.

05:25.970 --> 05:33.690
So if a push up see we want this to be step four.

05:34.700 --> 05:42.840
And the title lets say interaction.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.100
So save that.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.560
Let's see what it looks like without the CSA.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.680
So it just looks like this.

05:51.690 --> 05:54.510
And notice I do have the same icons here in here.

05:54.510 --> 05:58.170
So if you want to change those out that's fine.

05:58.170 --> 06:04.080
I just didn't want to go crazy looking for icons because the content is really not that important.

06:04.080 --> 06:09.880
You can only switch out the content it's the markup in the CSF that we're really paying attention to.

06:09.960 --> 06:18.660
So let's add some of those utility classes so we have let's see we want our clear class we want the

06:18.660 --> 06:26.760
process to that's not really a that's not a utility class but we did have lead which I think we already

06:26.820 --> 06:29.760
added Let's see do we add lead.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.560
Yes you did.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.930
There was bottom line.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.310
We didn't add that yet.

06:34.650 --> 06:38.310
So it's go down here.

06:38.310 --> 06:45.770
This is utilities SPSS and let's do bottom dash line.

06:46.650 --> 06:46.950
All right.

06:46.980 --> 06:54.130
So for bottom line we're just going to do a do a height.

06:55.070 --> 06:55.400
OK.

06:55.410 --> 06:58.590
So it's just gonna be just a line with the main color.

06:58.590 --> 07:02.610
So let's do a height of two pixels.

07:02.610 --> 07:16.500
Let's do a width of three ram let's do a background of the main color and let's make this display block

07:18.410 --> 07:26.340
and then let's add a little margin so I'm going to do margin let's do zero auto 1 auto on the left and

07:26.340 --> 07:32.150
right we'll do one room and then auto.

07:32.520 --> 07:37.750
So let's save that and you can see right here this is what it looks like.

07:37.820 --> 07:38.080
OK.

07:38.080 --> 07:43.710
And if you want to make it thicker if you want to increase the width that's that's fine to just make

07:43.710 --> 07:46.730
sure OK.

07:46.730 --> 07:51.690
So one thing that another thing we have to add is the title see how this one is bigger.

07:51.690 --> 07:55.980
That's because we didn't add the section title I believe that's what we named it.

07:56.130 --> 07:59.850
So we have class section title.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.390
So let's put that right here.

08:02.430 --> 08:10.440
Say section dash title and it's a utility class because we use it over and over in different parts of

08:10.440 --> 08:10.980
the site.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.090
So I'm going to set the font size to be a little bigger.

08:14.100 --> 08:21.820
Let's do two RAM and let's set the let's make it display block.

08:21.840 --> 08:30.960
Let's make the padding bottom let's say zero point five RAM and let's align it to the center

08:34.470 --> 08:35.270
which it already is.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.610
But it doesn't hurt just to add that just to make sure.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.000
So I'm going to say Fine.

08:40.990 --> 08:50.790
Wait let's do a font weight of one hundred and let's make it up make sure it's uppercase of text transform

08:51.620 --> 08:52.900
uppercase.

08:53.010 --> 08:53.310
OK.

08:53.330 --> 08:57.430
So let's take a look at it now and that looks better.

08:57.730 --> 09:02.530
OK you can see we have the title and the bottom line.

09:02.550 --> 09:06.550
All right so let's start to work on the.

09:07.220 --> 09:07.550
The.

09:07.850 --> 09:10.440
The whole process area.

09:10.440 --> 09:18.020
So we're going to go back to our main dot SPSS and let's see we have.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.280
Remember we have our home.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.870
We have home dash a home dash B.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.250
Now we want to work on a home dash C..

09:24.340 --> 09:31.970
So I want to go to the end of the dash B which is right here and let's say home section C..

09:31.970 --> 09:40.760
And we'll do Ampersand dash C and I want to work on the process div.

09:40.980 --> 09:41.350
OK.

09:41.370 --> 09:45.690
So we're gonna display this as a grid.

09:45.690 --> 09:50.520
And let's do our grid template columns.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.100
And I'm going to use a repeat.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.780
Let's do repeat four times one fraction.

09:56.780 --> 10:02.240
So we have four four even columns will set a grid gap.

10:02.240 --> 10:06.260
I'm going to go a little larger going to do one point five room for the grid gap.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.900
And just text align everything to the center.

10:10.900 --> 10:11.310
OK.

10:11.340 --> 10:15.510
Now we want to take each process step.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.930
So if we look at our each team all we have right.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.420
Is it's right here.

10:21.420 --> 10:28.800
The process step class which surrounds the number which is this right here the circle part.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.610
So we're going to work on that.

10:30.840 --> 10:38.880
Now since the class is called process dash step we can simply go within process and we can just do Ampersand

10:38.910 --> 10:41.760
dash step.

10:41.860 --> 10:42.230
All right.

10:42.240 --> 10:52.320
Now I'm going to position it absolute because I want to move it in word and then we're gonna set the

10:52.320 --> 10:57.780
top to zero and the right to zero

11:00.800 --> 11:04.830
K and then let's do a font size.

11:05.430 --> 11:16.070
I'm actually going to set this to a pixel 28 pixels and then let's set the background so background

11:16.070 --> 11:21.010
is going to be the main color.

11:21.130 --> 11:21.400
All right.

11:21.410 --> 11:24.590
Let me just check that room quick.

11:24.620 --> 11:24.810
Yes.

11:24.830 --> 11:29.540
So it's going to be main color but when we try to hover over it it's going to transition into the dark

11:29.540 --> 11:30.660
color.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.210
So let's see.

11:32.480 --> 11:38.810
Well this should be background either background color or just background and then we're going to set

11:38.810 --> 11:45.080
the ball we want it to be circle a circle behind it so we're going to set border radius to 50 percent

11:45.980 --> 11:55.260
and let's set a height of 15 pixels and a width of 15 pixels OK.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.660
And then we're gonna set a line height of the same.

11:57.660 --> 12:02.800
So 15 pixels and 4 padding.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.300
I'll do one room and we want it to transition.

12:07.530 --> 12:08.960
So we'll add transition.

12:08.970 --> 12:10.800
All I'm going to do one second.

12:11.740 --> 12:12.090
OK.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.260
So that's our step.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.480
Now we want to work on the icon.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.500
Now remember we we gave it a custom class of process dash icon.

12:19.500 --> 12:29.920
So within this process right here we go go after the step and we'll just do dash icon and like that.

12:29.920 --> 12:35.340
And again if you want to comment this like we could say this is the process dash icon

12:39.040 --> 12:41.920
process dash step

12:44.600 --> 12:51.500
so for the icon what I'm going to do is set a border radius because again we want it to be certain circles

12:51.530 --> 13:00.150
so we'll do 50 percent and let's set the background to the dark color variable.

13:01.130 --> 13:04.600
Let's set the color to we'll do white.

13:05.060 --> 13:13.960
And then the padding 2 to room and then we want this to be excuse me much bigger than this.

13:13.970 --> 13:20.530
The step so I'm going to set it to 70 pixels and also set the height to 70.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.010
OK.

13:23.020 --> 13:31.190
And then let's set the line height to the same thing height to 70 pixels.

13:31.190 --> 13:35.690
And then let's make sure it's text aligned center.

13:36.050 --> 13:43.840
And we want to position this relative because the step is inside the icon.

13:43.850 --> 13:48.310
Price should it put the icon styling first but it doesn't really matter.

13:48.470 --> 13:52.510
And then I'm gonna add transition for this transform.

13:52.520 --> 13:59.130
We want to transition and I'm going to do all one second OK.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.850
Now let's just save that and see what we get.

14:02.870 --> 14:04.600
So that's what we get.

14:05.080 --> 14:09.500
And when it loads it does it did the transition just because it was the first load with live server

14:09.740 --> 14:11.810
but you can see that that looks pretty good.

14:11.810 --> 14:16.410
However we do want that hover effect and we want them to transition.

14:16.460 --> 14:16.790
All right.

14:16.820 --> 14:26.460
So actually you know what guys I'm not exactly sure why had the clear class in their so we're going

14:26.460 --> 14:27.240
to get rid of that.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.220
There is no flow.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.390
I don't I actually don't know why I did that.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.560
So we're just going to clear the ups.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.100
I'm going to clear these out.

14:34.110 --> 14:37.420
Sorry about that.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.080
Oh see you get those.

14:40.100 --> 14:43.690
This one this one

14:47.310 --> 14:48.640
OK.

14:49.200 --> 14:56.580
So now like I said we're going to work on the hover so let's go back to main dot SPSS and we're gonna

14:56.580 --> 14:59.220
do the hover on the icons.

14:59.220 --> 15:08.910
So you want to make sure you're within the icon and we want to add Ampersand coal and hover and we want

15:08.910 --> 15:10.500
to set the background.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.210
So remember we're dealing with the icons.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.350
We want to set the background to the main color.

15:14.370 --> 15:18.150
By default it's the dark color and then we want to set the width.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.570
I'm going to make it grow a little bit.

15:19.590 --> 15:29.520
So we're going to do 90 pixels height 90 pixels and also the line height 90 pixels.

15:29.520 --> 15:29.880
OK.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.020
Now the process step I also want to change I want to change that.

15:33.150 --> 15:36.210
The color of that which by default is the main color.

15:36.210 --> 15:38.750
I want to reverse it to the dark color.

15:38.790 --> 15:53.700
So when we hover over the icon we also want the class of process step to change the background to the

15:53.730 --> 15:55.570
dark color.

15:55.590 --> 16:05.010
OK so let's try it we'll save it and go down here and hover over and you can see that the icon process

16:05.010 --> 16:08.460
icon grows from 70 to 90.

16:08.460 --> 16:16.710
Changes the background color and then the absolute positioned process step class changes the color as

16:16.710 --> 16:21.220
well and they both transition nicely over one second.

16:21.540 --> 16:21.830
All right.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.730
So that's it for that part.

16:23.730 --> 16:28.290
Now we want to we want to deal with the footer which shouldn't be too bad.

16:28.290 --> 16:36.030
So let's go back into index each team now and let's go down below the last section here and create our

16:36.030 --> 16:36.450
footer

16:40.170 --> 16:41.400
so we'll put.

16:41.820 --> 16:51.480
Let's do a footer tag and let's give it an idea of main dash footer and we're gonna have a class in

16:51.480 --> 16:55.130
here called footer dash content.

16:55.230 --> 17:00.030
And I'm also I also want to contain or so I'm just gonna add that here as well.

17:00.030 --> 17:07.770
And then in here we'll put a paragraph or say copy right Ampersand copy semicolon which will give us

17:07.800 --> 17:12.510
a little copyright symbol 20 19.

17:12.540 --> 17:15.800
All rights reserved.

17:15.870 --> 17:23.070
And then under that I want the social icons which I'm going to put in a class called social and let's

17:23.070 --> 17:30.340
do some fun awesome icons so f a f a b is what we want to use for the social media icons and I'm gonna

17:30.360 --> 17:34.780
do Twitter so F.A. dash Twitter.

17:34.950 --> 17:41.150
Copy this down four times and we want Facebook.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.020
Let's do Instagram

17:46.120 --> 17:49.770
and let's do LinkedIn.

17:49.770 --> 17:50.140
All right.

17:50.590 --> 17:54.940
So if we take a look at that without any CSX it should look like this.

17:55.300 --> 18:02.710
So now let's go back into main dot SPSS and let's deal with the footer.

18:02.710 --> 18:06.940
So we want to be and see we want to be outside of everything.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.800
So just go down to the bottom here

18:11.980 --> 18:14.230
and let's do I.D..

18:14.290 --> 18:26.440
Main dash footer and the footer itself will give a background let's do a dark color color.

18:26.440 --> 18:33.720
We'll say white and let's do a height of we'll do five REM.

18:33.880 --> 18:39.420
Now the footer content I'm going to style which is inside the main footer so we can put it in here.

18:39.430 --> 18:42.580
So footer dash content

18:45.220 --> 18:52.710
and I'm going to use flex here so we'll say display flex and let's do justify content space between.

18:53.740 --> 19:01.810
So remember the footer has to the week we gave this photo content a class I mean I'm sorry a display

19:01.810 --> 19:07.840
of flax and we have the paragraph and then we have this div as flex items and we want space between

19:07.840 --> 19:09.820
because we want them on each side.

19:10.030 --> 19:14.580
So we want to put all the remaining space in between.

19:14.850 --> 19:24.150
Next thing I'm going to set the height to the same as the parent as the main foot or so 5 room and then

19:24.150 --> 19:32.760
let's do a line items one of the line items to the center.

19:34.100 --> 19:34.530
OK.

19:34.530 --> 19:43.230
Now we want to take care of the icons so let's see the icons are still inside footer content.

19:43.260 --> 19:52.730
So we can stay within here and we'll say dot social and then I want to style the icons which all have

19:52.730 --> 19:55.120
a class of FCB.

19:55.210 --> 19:55.520
OK.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.380
So I'm going to give them a margin right.

19:57.380 --> 20:00.850
Just to separate them a little bit of one room.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.860
Let's do a border.

20:04.300 --> 20:14.750
We'll do border two pixels white and solid and let's do a border radius because we want them to be circular

20:15.150 --> 20:19.550
a radius of 50 percent.

20:19.970 --> 20:25.460
And let's do a height height width and line height of 20 pixels

20:33.010 --> 20:37.190
OK and then let's do text align center

20:40.250 --> 20:44.240
and let's do a little bit of padding so we'll do zero point five.

20:44.900 --> 20:45.220
OK.

20:45.230 --> 20:47.980
Now when we hover them we want the main color.

20:47.990 --> 20:55.640
So within this social FCB class we're just gonna do Ampersand call and hover

20:58.340 --> 21:04.490
and just set the background to the main color.

21:04.520 --> 21:04.860
All right.

21:04.860 --> 21:05.360
And that's it.

21:05.390 --> 21:09.350
So let's save that and go back and you can see our photo looks pretty good.

21:09.350 --> 21:12.170
We have the hover effect on the icons.

21:12.230 --> 21:20.710
Now the last thing I want to do is I want to use the set text color function that we created in the

21:20.720 --> 21:26.900
last section because I think that'll be helpful if we want to change you know the main color or dark

21:26.900 --> 21:29.040
color any background color at all.

21:29.060 --> 21:34.020
So let's go into we're going to put this in our config with our variables.

21:34.040 --> 21:41.450
So this config is usually where I would put any variables mix ins functions things like that.

21:41.450 --> 21:53.990
So let's just say set text color and let's do at function and we want to call this set text color and

21:53.990 --> 21:59.720
it's going to take in a color which is going to be basically the background color and then we're gonna

21:59.750 --> 22:08.030
do simple conditions so we'll do if we're gonna test the lightness so we'll see if the lightness of

22:08.030 --> 22:18.860
the color that's passed in is greater than 50 then we want to return the color of black.

22:19.530 --> 22:20.030
We need.

22:20.240 --> 22:27.400
We need at symbol here and then we're gonna do an else

22:30.150 --> 22:37.280
K ls then we want to return a white color.

22:37.530 --> 22:38.740
OK.

22:39.050 --> 22:41.110
And if you want to change up the colors that's fine.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.800
Can you use black and white.

22:42.910 --> 22:48.820
So we'll save that and let's see what I actually want to implement this.

22:48.880 --> 22:53.780
Let's go to see.

22:56.050 --> 23:03.730
So basically wherever we have a background color we can implement this

23:07.020 --> 23:11.790
this see.

23:13.800 --> 23:19.980
So the divs background color we don't need to do it.

23:19.980 --> 23:26.880
Actually I don't know if there's I don't know if we actually need to put this anywhere just yet.

23:32.680 --> 23:36.430
So right here the actually for the icon we should probably do that.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.510
I mean we take a look here.

23:38.590 --> 23:45.550
So here if we wanted to change these icons to have a light background then we would want the icons themselves

23:45.550 --> 23:46.240
to be dark.

23:46.270 --> 23:57.370
So we should implement it here so instead of just white let's do a set dash text dash color and let's

23:57.370 --> 24:00.690
pass in dark color.

24:00.730 --> 24:01.850
OK we'll save that.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.310
We should get the same result.

24:04.360 --> 24:11.500
However if we were to change both of these two light then the text should change dark or the icon.

24:11.550 --> 24:11.950
Yep.

24:11.990 --> 24:14.230
There we go.

24:14.230 --> 24:15.410
Good.

24:15.460 --> 24:26.530
It's going to change those back and then we should probably do do the same thing with with the step.

24:26.530 --> 24:33.290
So let's add right below it a color and let's set that to set.

24:33.460 --> 24:42.230
Text color and pass in the main color and we'll take a look.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.710
Good.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.170
So if we were to to make the background light on that

24:49.780 --> 24:51.850
change both of these to light.

24:51.860 --> 24:55.420
So now just the step should be light but it should have a dark.

24:55.430 --> 24:55.820
There we go.

24:55.820 --> 24:58.460
Has a dark text.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.690
Oh we probably want to do it to the hover too as you can see now you can't see the number.

25:03.740 --> 25:09.650
So on the hover right here let's also add color set

25:12.100 --> 25:18.700
text color dark color and that will decide and it will make it light.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.160
So let's just try that out now and hover it.

25:22.170 --> 25:23.400
You'll see that it turns light.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.230
Good.

25:24.270 --> 25:35.730
So let's change the main color back to main for the step here so those two main color.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.790
Well it was it main or was it dark.

25:37.790 --> 25:41.780
No it's dark.

25:42.120 --> 25:42.930
No it was me.

25:42.930 --> 25:43.760
Sorry.

25:45.390 --> 25:46.920
All right.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.060
There you go.

25:48.060 --> 25:48.370
OK.

25:48.360 --> 25:53.900
And if you find other places where you want to use that function you can do that as well.

25:53.910 --> 25:54.210
All right.

25:54.210 --> 26:01.080
So I think that that's it for this video and that's it for the home page as far as aside from making

26:01.080 --> 26:02.280
it responsive.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.880
So in the next video we're going to start on the about page.
