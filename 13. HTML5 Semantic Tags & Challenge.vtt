All right guys so before each team all five we would put everything in divs much like you saw in not

00:07.260 --> 00:11.670
the not the last video but the one before that where we had an idea of MAIN HEADER we had an idea of

00:11.670 --> 00:19.200
main nav with each team of five we got semantic tags like header footer nav so we can actually describe

00:19.560 --> 00:21.700
what is in that tag.

00:21.840 --> 00:28.200
Now this isn't just for organization although it is excellent for organization it's also for accessibility

00:28.200 --> 00:33.720
it helps people with disabilities that you know that have hearing disabilities vision disabilities it

00:33.720 --> 00:37.400
helps them understand what goes where.

00:37.410 --> 00:42.890
So they're very important to use instead of just using divs which have no meaning at all.

00:42.900 --> 00:48.960
So these are the more the more popular each HTML5 tags there are a couple other ones but these are the

00:48.960 --> 00:49.810
main ones.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.680
And then I just have a sample that I found on the Internet that kind of shows you what goes where it's

00:55.680 --> 00:59.040
not using all of these but I'm going to explain each one.

00:59.040 --> 01:04.030
So basically we have the header and footer that's pretty self-explanatory as you can see here headers

01:04.080 --> 01:06.990
usually go at the top four is usually go at the bottom.

01:07.110 --> 01:12.210
A lot of times your header will have like a logo you may have your navigation in your head or you may

01:12.210 --> 01:13.540
have it underneath.

01:13.710 --> 01:17.300
He may have like a search box or something like that.

01:17.340 --> 01:21.270
Next we have NAV which is used for navigation.

01:21.270 --> 01:26.850
I don't have an example on this but let's say you have a Navarre here which would be a well an unordered

01:26.850 --> 01:29.850
list and then you'd wrap it in the NAV tag.

01:29.850 --> 01:30.300
OK.

01:30.300 --> 01:37.170
Or maybe you have a side menu which is a well that you wrap in a nav tag main which also is on here

01:37.680 --> 01:43.320
could be wrapped around this whole area which is like the main content of the page or maybe even around

01:43.320 --> 01:44.050
this whole thing.

01:44.050 --> 01:47.100
There's no like special science to this.

01:47.130 --> 01:52.410
Some of it is preference but there are just some general rules to follow it just generally means the

01:52.410 --> 01:56.670
main content of your page and a lot of times people don't even use main.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.920
They'll just split it into sections.

01:59.670 --> 02:08.280
But yeah you can use main section is going to be just that for instance the the about div that we had

02:08.280 --> 02:09.860
and then the contact div.

02:10.020 --> 02:14.940
That's where I would use this section instead of using a div there I'd say section and maybe still give

02:14.940 --> 02:21.600
it an idea of about or whatever and then article is going to be used for just that if there's an article

02:21.600 --> 02:28.710
post or a blog post a lot of times you'll see multiple blog posts and then maybe a read more button

02:28.710 --> 02:32.180
or something those could be wrapped in Article tags.

02:32.250 --> 02:40.200
OK instead of divs and then a side is just that it's sidebar content or just content that isn't it's

02:40.200 --> 02:47.670
not the main focus of the page it could be maybe an ADD or it could be like a category section for the

02:47.670 --> 02:49.900
main blog section or something like that.

02:50.700 --> 02:50.970
OK.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.900
So these are the HMO five semantic tags now I'm gonna give you a little challenge and I want to give

02:57.900 --> 03:06.400
you a layout that only uses divs and I want you to figure out where to put these semantic tags.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.610
OK all the ones that I just showed you.

03:08.610 --> 03:16.080
So let's go ahead and create a new file here we'll call this 11 underscore each team of five underscore

03:17.370 --> 03:24.480
semantics start each Timo and you're going to have this each team I'll file in your project files for

03:24.480 --> 03:31.920
this video and I'm going to paste it in and it does have a bunch of CSX up at the top in the style Don't

03:31.920 --> 03:37.010
worry about this I just wanted it to look like an actual web page we're going to learn how to do all

03:37.030 --> 03:42.400
this later on but just pay attention to the H team Al so I'm going to save this and open it up just

03:42.600 --> 03:44.030
see what it looks like.

03:44.220 --> 03:48.660
OK so it's not very good looking but it is laid out like an actual Web site.

03:48.810 --> 03:58.950
So we have a header we have our main area we have this section here this section here we also have some

03:58.950 --> 04:03.780
articles in the section and then we have our sidebar with a navigation.

04:03.780 --> 04:08.380
So keep that stuff in mind keep those elements in mind and let's look at the aged email.

04:08.610 --> 04:15.450
So we have a div with the idea of header right down here we have a div with the idea of main we have

04:15.840 --> 04:21.830
a div with the idea of welcome and the comments should give you hints as well welcome s..

04:21.930 --> 04:29.460
We have the blog section we have Article 1 Article 2 but notice that they're all using div so I just

04:29.460 --> 04:33.820
want you to figure out where the each team 0 5 Ellen tags go.

04:33.960 --> 04:40.390
We have a sidebar inside the sidebar we have our navigation and then we have our footer.

04:40.440 --> 04:40.740
OK.

04:40.740 --> 04:41.740
Don't worry about this clear.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.330
This just has to do with the floats we just floated using CSF.

04:45.330 --> 04:46.640
So we had to clear it.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.880
Don't worry about that.

04:48.750 --> 04:56.460
So just take a look at this and take a look at this and figure out what goes where.

04:56.490 --> 04:56.780
OK.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.590
And I'll even do the first one for you.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.220
So for header we have this div..

05:01.270 --> 05:10.090
So what I would do is replace this with header and then the ending tag also with header and we can keep

05:10.090 --> 05:11.360
and keep the I.D..

05:11.730 --> 05:12.090
OK.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.350
If we were going to style it or something we could even style it just by the element itself.

05:16.360 --> 05:22.230
But you may want to keep the I.D. but that's the first one I'm going to do so take a look at the rest.

05:22.390 --> 05:28.560
And I want you to replace certain divs where you think they should be replaced with these each team

05:28.570 --> 05:30.370
all five semantic tags.

05:30.400 --> 05:30.720
OK.

05:30.730 --> 05:34.450
And then in the next video I'll give you my my solution.
