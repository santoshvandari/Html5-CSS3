Hello and welcome to Modern Age Tim Allen CEO says from the beginning in this video we just want to

00:12.100 --> 00:15.630
talk a little bit about what you can expect from this course.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.310
So this is going to be a comprehensive course on age.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.540
Tim Allen CSX.

00:19.540 --> 00:24.000
And we're going to start from the absolute beginning starting with each HTML5 markup.

00:24.010 --> 00:31.240
We'll go through all the basics of CSX to the latest features like flex box CSX grid animation variables

00:31.240 --> 00:33.480
responsive design and much more.

00:33.520 --> 00:39.550
Not only that you'll also learn SAS in this course which is a CSX pre compiler that extends the syntax

00:39.550 --> 00:44.520
of CSX to include things like nesting inheritance functions and more.

00:44.530 --> 00:50.350
This course is composed of both learning sections where we'll basically be working in a sandbox to look

00:50.350 --> 00:56.050
at certain features and then we have about a half dozen projects ranging in size and then some mini

00:56.050 --> 00:58.530
projects on top of that.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.430
So who is this course actually for.

01:00.430 --> 01:05.620
The short answer is everyone whether you're an absolute beginner learn looking to learn how to build

01:05.620 --> 01:12.850
Web sites how Web sites work or a seasoned developer that wants to get better at CSX SAS and UI creation

01:12.850 --> 01:16.360
in general without having to rely on frameworks like bootstrap.

01:16.780 --> 01:22.340
So Sections 1 through 4 are geared more towards beginners as we go over the basics of each team Alan

01:22.390 --> 01:23.310
CSX.

01:23.320 --> 01:29.470
So if you're comfortable with things like each team 0 5 and CSX topics like font styles basic alignment

01:29.470 --> 01:36.160
margin and padding things like that then feel free to skip these sections and start using FLAC CSX grid

01:36.190 --> 01:37.820
animation in SAS.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.830
So here's a summary of some of the things that we'll be going over in this course.

01:41.830 --> 01:47.230
So we'll start with the basics of how Web sites work and how the internet works in general in terms

01:47.230 --> 01:53.560
of IP addresses how exactly a Web site that's stored on a server somewhere else gets displayed in your

01:53.560 --> 01:54.380
browser.

01:54.430 --> 01:59.860
We'll look at setup and tools we're using a text editor called V.S. code which is definitely the most

01:59.860 --> 02:02.330
popular editor in the web development world.

02:02.500 --> 02:08.140
And we'll be using tools such as Emmett will install a couple of different extensions as well get a

02:08.140 --> 02:15.520
workflow going we'll look at each team all five in terms of just the core basics of tags and attributes.

02:15.550 --> 02:21.160
We'll look at all the basic tags we'll also look at these semantic tags like header footer aside things

02:21.160 --> 02:26.380
like that and show you how to structure in each a proper each team 0 five document.

02:26.530 --> 02:33.340
We'll be looking at CSX fundamentals like the box model font styles things like that responsive design

02:33.520 --> 02:40.000
so media queries making everything look good on mobile devices including smartphones and tablets.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.170
Every single project we create is going to be responsive.

02:43.420 --> 02:50.530
We'll be looking at flex box CSX grid which are ways to align columns and rows.

02:50.560 --> 02:57.780
We'll be looking at animation with transitions in key frames CNS variables transform pseudo selectors.

02:57.820 --> 03:03.610
We'll be building things like sticky menus overlays we'll be styling forms and landing pages we'll even

03:03.610 --> 03:05.330
look at Web site deployment.

03:05.410 --> 03:10.960
So making your website live on the Internet using a shared host we'll also be looking at a platform

03:10.960 --> 03:12.060
called Net LA fi.

03:12.340 --> 03:18.430
And then finally we'll look at SAS which is a CSA as pre compiler to allow us to basically extend the

03:18.430 --> 03:24.100
functionality of CSX and we'll create a portfolio project with that.

03:24.160 --> 03:24.490
All right.

03:24.490 --> 03:29.230
So as I said this is going to be a mix of learning sections and projects the learning lectures will

03:29.230 --> 03:34.730
include specific topics such as the box model media queries and many other things.

03:34.810 --> 03:40.130
And then we'll also have six good sized projects along with some other mini projects.

03:40.150 --> 03:46.330
So the first Web site project we'll be building is this hotel Web site which is before we even get into

03:46.330 --> 03:52.870
flex box in the grid and anything like that we'll be using just basic CSX here including floats because

03:52.900 --> 03:58.180
I think it's important to learn the basics even though for the most part you're going to be using flex

03:58.180 --> 04:05.490
or the grid next project is this edge ledger Web site which is a single page site for a financial company.

04:05.530 --> 04:10.180
It includes flex box image overlay sticky menu things like that.

04:10.180 --> 04:14.230
We will be implementing a little bit of JavaScript for a smooth scroll.

04:14.230 --> 04:16.220
We'll be doing this in a couple projects.

04:16.270 --> 04:18.850
However javascript is not the focus of this course.

04:18.850 --> 04:23.800
I just want to make that clear we will be using a little bit of it but we're not going to really get

04:23.800 --> 04:31.180
into javascript discourses more about UI and each team LCROSS and SAS so the next project is a news

04:31.180 --> 04:39.100
grid site where we use CSX grid we use grid template columns and I show you how to span rows and things

04:39.100 --> 04:39.860
like that.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.500
Next we'll build a landing page that uses a hamburger menu.

04:43.510 --> 04:47.740
So you guys have probably seen this before you click it and it opens up a menu.

04:47.800 --> 04:54.260
We'll have a big overlay that has the menu items will also animate the the the hamburger menu itself.

04:54.380 --> 04:58.870
Then we have a CSX timeline project where we have different items on the timeline.

04:58.930 --> 05:03.610
We're going to add a little bit of JavaScript here to bring the items in from the side as we scroll

05:03.610 --> 05:11.050
down and then the last project is a asked project will recreate a four page portfolio site with a home

05:11.080 --> 05:19.900
about a work page with some pretty in-depth CSI s animations transitions and then a contact page and

05:19.900 --> 05:25.480
we're going to deploy this to a platform called nullify and make the contact page actually work with

05:25.480 --> 05:27.100
spam filtering.

05:27.100 --> 05:27.450
All right.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.270
So that's it.

05:28.270 --> 05:31.050
Hopefully you enjoy the course and learn a lot from it.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.180
So let's jump in and get started.
