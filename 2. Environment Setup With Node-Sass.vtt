WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:00.800
All right guys.

00:00.810 --> 00:07.340
Now we're gonna go ahead and set up nodes SAS so that we can compile our SPSS files and our SAS code.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.930
So you need to go to no J.S. dot org.

00:09.930 --> 00:14.490
If you don't already have installed and just go ahead and install either the long term support or the

00:14.490 --> 00:18.960
current version for latest features doesn't really matter in this situation.

00:18.960 --> 00:25.140
Now we're gonna jump into this code and I just have an empty folder called SAS sandbox and we need to

00:25.140 --> 00:27.110
use the terminal or the command line.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.120
I'm going to use my integrated terminal.

00:29.160 --> 00:35.250
We can open that and V.S. code with control till day or you can go to the View menu and just go to a

00:35.250 --> 00:42.120
terminal or you can use your standard Mac terminal windows command prompt Linux terminal whatever and

00:42.120 --> 00:46.850
just do a quick NPM dash dash version just to make sure you have NPM installed.

00:47.280 --> 00:47.720
OK.

00:47.730 --> 00:53.460
And then what we want to do is create a package dot Jason File since or installing anything with NPM

00:53.880 --> 00:59.940
and we can generate that with NPM and net and then I'm also going to add on Dash y so that we don't

00:59.940 --> 01:03.540
have to answer a bunch of questions it will just give us the defaults.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.610
OK so let's go out and run that.

01:05.770 --> 01:09.870
I'll clear this up with control L and in our package.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.620
JASON It just has the name the version all that stuff.

01:13.620 --> 01:17.540
Once we install node SAS it should get listed in here as a dependency.

01:17.550 --> 01:22.770
So let's say npm install node dash SAS

01:27.770 --> 01:32.810
OK so it's going to install it in a folder called Node modules and you can see it's listed here as a

01:32.810 --> 01:34.320
dependency.

01:34.370 --> 01:38.870
Now in order to use node SAS we're going to create an NPM script.

01:39.020 --> 01:44.990
So inside here the scripts we don't need this test I'm actually gonna change this to SAS.

01:45.170 --> 01:53.590
That way we can just run NPM run run SAS and then in here we want it to run node SAS.

01:53.870 --> 02:01.880
We want to set a watch flag so dash w we want it to constantly watch a folder called SPSS which we haven't

02:01.880 --> 02:02.630
created yet.

02:03.500 --> 02:13.520
So SPSS slash and then we want it to output dash 0 to a folder called dist slash CSX dist is where basically

02:13.520 --> 02:14.800
our project is going to live.

02:14.810 --> 02:20.450
The H team l files the CSX anything that we would deploy will be in that dist folder and then we're

02:20.450 --> 02:24.050
just going to add a dash dash recursive flag here.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.000
All right.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.410
So that should be good.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.480
Let's go ahead and save this and we'll close it up.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.580
And now what I'll do is create a folder called SPSS and this is where all of our SAS files will go.

02:37.580 --> 02:45.410
So let's create a file called Main dot SPSS and you can see it as a little SAS logo there.

02:45.410 --> 02:51.950
Now we also want to create a folder called dest and this is where the compiled CSX is going to go as

02:51.950 --> 02:53.930
we directed in our script.

02:53.930 --> 03:02.690
So let's go ahead and clear this up down here and let's run NPM run SAS.

03:02.690 --> 03:10.030
Now what this is going to do is it's going to constantly watch the SPSS folder in any SAS files in it.

03:10.040 --> 03:15.230
And as soon as we save it'll compile into dist CSX which we haven't even created.

03:15.290 --> 03:17.720
We don't have to create it we'll do it on its own.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.930
So we'll test this out by just creating a variable and I'm going to discuss variables and stuff in depth.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.420
I just want to test it out.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.640
So going to say we want to see color.

03:26.840 --> 03:38.060
We'll set that to red and let's say a body and we'll set the background to the variable of color.

03:38.360 --> 03:38.580
OK.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.590
So this is SAS.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.240
This is not regular CSX.

03:41.240 --> 03:46.970
Now I'm going to save it with control s and as soon as I save it it'll tell us down here that rendering

03:46.970 --> 03:53.500
is complete and if we look in disk we now have a CSX file with a main dot CSX.

03:53.510 --> 03:53.760
OK.

03:53.780 --> 03:59.230
So it's going to copy the name which we called Main and it's going to just name it that but it's going

03:59.230 --> 04:04.210
to be a CSX file and if we look in that it's just body background red.

04:04.260 --> 04:04.590
OK.

04:04.610 --> 04:11.300
So it takes the SAS with these variables compiles it down to this CSX and then this is what we include

04:11.330 --> 04:12.580
in our HD CML.

04:12.830 --> 04:20.100
So in dist I'm going to create a file called index dot HD CML and we'll just put in our boilerplate

04:20.180 --> 04:32.810
here and let's call this SAS sandbox and we want to link to CSF slash main dot CSX and we'll just put

04:32.810 --> 04:33.680
an H1

04:38.210 --> 04:39.370
and we'll save that.

04:39.370 --> 04:46.380
Now we can open this each team out with a live server and now we have a red background.

04:46.380 --> 04:46.990
OK.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.890
Now if I go back into my SAS file.

04:49.910 --> 04:54.310
This is where you want to do all your styling you don't want to touch the CSX just the SAS.

04:54.320 --> 05:00.770
I'm going to change this to Blu ray and as soon as I save that you'll see down here it renders and then

05:01.160 --> 05:04.220
we can go back and now we have a blue background.

05:04.220 --> 05:04.450
OK.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.560
So our entire environment is set up.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.960
Now when you're ready to deploy you will just take this disk folder.

05:10.970 --> 05:15.320
KAY That's this other stuff node modules you all your SAS package.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.710
Jason this is your development environment.

05:17.790 --> 05:18.010
OK.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.090
This only has to do with your development.

05:20.090 --> 05:25.500
This disk is your actual project your actual product that you would deploy.

05:25.520 --> 05:25.820
All right.

05:25.820 --> 05:29.440
So that's how we work with node SAS and we're going to come back to this.

05:29.450 --> 05:36.110
But in the next video I want to show you another option which is using graphical program called koala.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.160
OK so we'll take a look at that and then we'll jump back in and we'll start to look at the features

05:40.160 --> 05:40.910
of SAS.
