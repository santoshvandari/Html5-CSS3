00:00.210 --> 00:04.320
All right so in this video I want to quickly talk about the different colored types that are commonly

00:04.320 --> 00:04.890
used.

00:04.890 --> 00:09.060
Now I'm not going to go over all of them but I'm going to go over the ones that you'll see for the most

00:09.060 --> 00:09.580
part.

00:09.690 --> 00:10.890
The most common types.

00:10.950 --> 00:18.360
So let's create a file called 0 4 underscore colors dot HD here Mel and let's put our boiler plate in

00:18.360 --> 00:22.940
here and we'll go ahead and change the title to colors.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.500
Let's add in our style tags.

00:26.310 --> 00:29.310
And as far as the body let's just put a couple headings

00:33.710 --> 00:35.330
let's do an H to here

00:39.780 --> 00:41.020
in an age three

00:45.090 --> 00:51.880
and then up in the style I'm going to grab the H one as a selector and give it a color property which

00:51.880 --> 00:55.230
is gonna be the color of the text.

00:55.240 --> 01:01.870
Okay now as far as colors go anything I'm going to show you you can use for the color property you can

01:01.870 --> 01:04.500
also use for it for the background color.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.280
You can also use for a border anything.

01:07.300 --> 01:12.100
And the first type is is a name so we can put like red in here.

01:12.100 --> 01:17.020
So let's save this and let's run it with this life server.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.650
So open that up and of course we have a red heading.

01:20.650 --> 01:23.770
So this is a color name.

01:23.830 --> 01:30.610
Now in addition to common colors like red blue green we have a bunch of not so common colors like for

01:30.610 --> 01:32.040
instance coral.

01:32.090 --> 01:32.800
We save that.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.830
You can see we get coral and envious code.

01:35.830 --> 01:41.050
If I just put any letter in like a G it's going to show us all the different options for the different

01:41.050 --> 01:42.160
color names.

01:42.160 --> 01:51.700
If I put in a C all these different colors of Aqua aquamarine a juror B all these beige blue violet

01:51.730 --> 01:56.710
Burley would some really weird names but anyways these are color names.

01:56.710 --> 02:01.360
So the second color type that we can use is in our G.B. value.

02:01.360 --> 02:09.160
So for the H two let's say our G.B. and this takes in three things three values red green and blue.

02:09.160 --> 02:14.010
And each value should be anywhere between 0 and 255.

02:14.140 --> 02:19.040
So if I do zero that means that the value for Red is zero.

02:19.110 --> 02:26.440
Let's do blue zero I'm sorry Green 0 and blue 0 and if I save that it's gonna be black because we have

02:26.440 --> 02:28.660
no presence of red green or blue.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.620
Now the highest you can go is 255.

02:31.630 --> 02:37.720
So if I say 255 four for the first one here and then V.S. code it even gives us a little preview here

02:37.750 --> 02:40.820
which is nice but if I save that we get red.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.570
Okay.

02:41.620 --> 02:47.970
Now if I wanted it slightly darker I could do like I don't know 2 10 and see now it's darker.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.740
And let's say I wanted to do all blue.

02:50.800 --> 02:58.600
I could go to the last one here 255 is the highest and it's it's Black is blue is it can get really

02:59.470 --> 03:06.850
now there's a lot of different color combinations obviously you can be anything between 0 and 255 for

03:06.850 --> 03:07.910
all of these.

03:07.960 --> 03:17.140
So if I do like let's say one hundred of green and maybe I don't know 20 of red and save we get this

03:17.140 --> 03:18.000
blue color.

03:18.190 --> 03:19.900
Let's let's tone this down a bit.

03:19.900 --> 03:27.820
We'll say like 120 and save and we get this color which is like a grayish blue and it gives you a little

03:27.820 --> 03:29.330
preview right here.

03:29.350 --> 03:36.510
So just remember that all zeros is black and then if you do all 250 fives take a crack at what that's

03:36.510 --> 03:44.890
gonna give us if all zeros are black then it's all 250 fives are gonna be white as you can see and you

03:44.890 --> 03:49.030
can't even read it because the background is white but as you can see it is there.

03:49.030 --> 03:52.330
So that's red green blue are G.B..

03:52.570 --> 03:58.270
Now the third type is the most common and the one that will be using the most and that's hexadecimal

03:58.300 --> 04:06.120
or hex which is base sixteen number and it pertains to the composition of a certain color in the RG

04:06.120 --> 04:06.980
B space.

04:07.210 --> 04:13.660
So it's always going to start with a number sine and it's gonna be six or three characters that are

04:13.660 --> 04:20.830
gonna be letters letters and or numbers for numbers it's gonna be it is either zero to nine or four

04:20.830 --> 04:30.430
letters it'll be a two F so all zeros is gonna be black and then all F's is gonna be white.

04:30.580 --> 04:38.800
Now just like RG b we have red green blue in hexadecimal we have read the first two green the second

04:38.800 --> 04:40.660
two in blue the last two.

04:40.660 --> 04:48.690
So if I wanted red I could do f f for red for the first 2 and then 0 0 green 0 0 blue.

04:48.700 --> 04:57.200
And that gives me red OK if I want a blue I'd put F for the last two like that and if I did f f in just

04:57.200 --> 05:01.920
the middle it would be green and then any combination of any of those.

05:01.940 --> 05:08.720
So just like our G.B. it's gonna give us just a color based off of the values of red green and blue.

05:08.780 --> 05:14.360
Now obviously you're not gonna remember all these different hex codes you may have some preferred colors

05:14.360 --> 05:19.940
that you use often that you'll remember but there's there's plenty of Web sites and software that you

05:19.940 --> 05:25.280
can use to to reference different colors and I'm going to give you an example in a minute but what you

05:25.280 --> 05:28.990
do want to remember is obviously black which is all zeros.

05:29.240 --> 05:34.580
Now when you have something that when you have hex value that's all the same you can actually cut it

05:34.580 --> 05:42.110
down to three so three zeros as black and three Fs as white K you want to remember that and then anything

05:42.110 --> 05:49.310
else that's going to be all the same like let's say three D or three C's it's gonna be a shade of gray

05:49.340 --> 05:52.460
because all the red green and blue values are the same.

05:52.460 --> 06:00.360
Same thing if we do like F for three times that's gonna be some shades of gray if we do e three that

06:00.360 --> 06:03.410
will be a shade of gray as you can see it's very light.

06:03.410 --> 06:09.050
So some common ones that I use are 3 3 3 which is almost black it's a really dark gray I think it's

06:09.050 --> 06:10.660
cleaner than using jet black.

06:10.670 --> 06:16.490
So I use it for a lot for backgrounds if I want to light background a lot of times I use f for like

06:16.490 --> 06:17.120
that.

06:17.150 --> 06:23.330
So those are just some of the ones that I keep in mind as far as color is like different blues or reds

06:23.330 --> 06:24.170
and stuff.

06:24.260 --> 06:28.500
I'll use a reference like this Web site here.

06:28.550 --> 06:31.100
This is color dash hex dot com.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.010
So we just have a palette here of different colors.

06:34.010 --> 06:39.740
These are just the latest favorite colors but we can go up here we can use the color palette but if

06:39.740 --> 06:45.190
I click one of these like let's say this blue right here let's say we're building an application or

06:45.200 --> 06:52.400
Web site we like this blue by click on that it shows us the hexadecimal the RG b value and then other

06:52.430 --> 06:59.960
color types as well that I didn't talk about like H S L HSV and you can use these and C Ss but I don't

07:00.020 --> 07:02.780
I mean they're not that common.

07:02.780 --> 07:08.240
Also what's cool about this site is if you go down you have a palette of different shades different

07:08.240 --> 07:10.850
shades and tents that have to do with this.

07:10.850 --> 07:16.220
This hexadecimal value because often you're going to want a color palette or a color scheme in your

07:16.220 --> 07:23.090
web site or your application with colors that relate to each other so you might have you know buttons

07:23.090 --> 07:27.800
that have this color and maybe your background has this color or something like that.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.060
And then down here you can see the percentages of our G.B..

07:31.130 --> 07:34.730
So this this gives you a lot of information on different colors.

07:34.730 --> 07:37.040
Gives you examples and CSX.

07:37.130 --> 07:42.050
So really really helpful side I would definitely bookmark this site.

07:42.050 --> 07:48.090
Another good one is each team l color codes dot com.

07:48.350 --> 07:51.010
And this one here you can see we have a color palette.

07:51.020 --> 07:56.420
We can just kind of slide and it gives us the hex value the RG G.B. the H has cell.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.640
So this is a pretty cool site as well.

07:58.640 --> 08:04.460
Down here we have a color chart we can click and it shows us in the header the different values.

08:04.490 --> 08:04.820
All right.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.670
So you'll learn more as we go along.

08:06.680 --> 08:13.310
But I just wanted you to understand these these three different types of colors that we can use in CSX

08:14.180 --> 08:15.880
and of course you can use color names.

08:15.890 --> 08:21.440
I prefer hacks like if I have to make something white or black I'll use the hex value a lot of people

08:21.440 --> 08:28.510
have asked me why why don't I just use white or or black but I like to be consistent.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.590
I don't like to just.

08:29.630 --> 08:35.360
I don't like to have color names mixed with hex values it's just kind of just it's just my thing.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.770
But you can do it any way you want.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.500
So just just keep that in mind.

08:38.540 --> 08:39.440
Everyone's different.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.420
Everyone does things differently.

08:41.420 --> 08:44.630
All right guys so that's it for this one and I'll see you in the next video.
